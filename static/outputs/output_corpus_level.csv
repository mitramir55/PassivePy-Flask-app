"The problem was with our trash pickup service provider. They conduct ""audits"" of the number of trashcans customers are using, but they way this do this is to just drive around and see how many are in front of each house. There is zero communication about this process. Our street is very crowded, and everyone has to squeeze their trashcans in wherever possible, so the placement of a can isn't indicative of whose it is. Without notice or communication, we were charged for two trashcans; when I called the company, they said they concluded that we had two trash cans instead of the one we pay for, and we were charged double. I said we only use one can, as our service records indicate, and asked how they determined we have more than one. The response was explaining the audit process. I asked if they thought we stole a can, since they can see that we never requested another can. They wouldn't give me a response. They said they would continue to charge us for two until they did another audit. I said this was unacceptable, because this situation was their own fault, and it's fraudulent to charge customers for a service they are not providing and which wasn't requested. Furthermore, I did not trust their audit system since it was clearly inaccurate, and that they ought to have communicated with us before charging us double. Their response was that we should write our house number on our can. We have, in fact, written the house number on the can, but the trash cans they provide are too slick for ink to stick for long (especially given that their drivers knock the cans over, run into them, and leave them in the middle of the road). I had to call our city council person since the city gave our trash contract to this company. After that , they finally called back and said they would adjust our account to reflect one can and give us a refund on that bill. The whole thing was entirely unacceptable.
