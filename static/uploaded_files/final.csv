"A few years ago, I was working as a pharmacy technician at a hospital. Every so often, a client would ask us to send a prescription to another pharmacy, so I would have to call the other pharmacy in question and speak to the pharmacist to place the order. In one instance, I was not aware of a certain federal regulation that made it mandatory to hand a written prescription to the pharmacist, so I could not place the order over the phone. The pharmacist that I spoke to was rude, yelled at me for not understanding the regulation, and hung up on me. I had to call the store and speak to the general manager about my experience, and I also wrote a complaint to corporate using their complaint form on the website. A few weeks later, I heard that this pharmacist was terminated.",5,2,3,5e365c3a1662ea5feaa6310a,2,30,N/A

"I was in New York City with a friend and we decided to order take out to bring back to our hotel room. My friend has a dairy allergy and most of the items on the menu had dairy. We had informed them of the allergy but the person taking our order did not know if some of the menu items contained dairy or not so we gave her a lot of options to choose from if she finds out they have dairy. When we got to the restaurant to pick up, it turned out that all of the items we ordered had dairy except 1 or 2. They gave us our order and we left to buy something else for my friend. When I opened the bag, it turns out that the waitress had taken out all of the things that I had ordered for myself, even though I was not allergic to dairy.

"The problem was with our trash pickup service provider. They conduct ""audits"" of the number of trashcans customers are using, but they way this do this is to just drive around and see how many are in front of each house. There is zero communication about this process. Our street is very crowded, and everyone has to squeeze their trashcans in wherever possible, so the placement of a can isn't indicative of whose it is. Without notice or communication, we were charged for two trashcans; when I called the company, they said they concluded that we had two trash cans instead of the one we pay for, and we were charged double. I said we only use one can, as our service records indicate, and asked how they determined we have more than one. The response was explaining the audit process. I asked if they thought we stole a can, since they can see that we never requested another can. They wouldn't give me a response. They said they would continue to charge us for two until they did another audit. I said this was unacceptable, because this situation was their own fault, and it's fraudulent to charge customers for a service they are not providing and which wasn't requested. Furthermore, I did not trust their audit system since it was clearly inaccurate, and that they ought to have communicated with us before charging us double. Their response was that we should write our house number on our can. We have, in fact, written the house number on the can, but the trash cans they provide are too slick for ink to stick for long (especially given that their drivers knock the cans over, run into them, and leave them in the middle of the road).

I used Postmates one time and never will again. I ordered using their website from a local restaurant in my city. I ordered two entrees and an appetizer and the total was quoted at $35. This sounded right since the entrees were about $10-$12 each and the appetizer was $6 and of course there are delivery fees. I ended up being charged $57 for the meal when it was all said and done. I tipped the delivery driver $10 in cash because I used to drive myself and know you have to claim credit card tips. I couldn't figure out why the cost was so much. Turns out their menu online had incorrect prices for the restaurant and they would  not honor the mistake. I wrote back and forth with them for days trying to get a refund for about $20 of what I considered being overcharged. I will never order from Post mates again.

We recently went on a trip with a total of 6 people to Florida. We all booked everything separately but booked the same flights. Our flights changed about 3 times before our trip. The last time they changed it pushed half of our flights returning home to the next day and half stayed on the same day. This would've caused half of us to get a hotel for an extra night and spend more money. One of our friends called the airline to see what flight we could all 6 fit on so that we could all leave at the same time. We still had to spend an extra night away but at least we got to split the hotel 6 ways instead of 3. ,1,7,-6,60ff1bffbbd1a9df9b157d0b,2,25,
"I bought a car battery online at Walmart to be picked up in the store.  I was charged a $12 core charge.  I went back to Walmart with the old battery to get the core charge taken off and refunded. They refused to do it because the receipt did not say core charge it said ""miscellaneous fee"". I had to call 1-800 Walmart to get a refund.  They should have been able to handle the refund but they refused. ",1,7,-6,578e195416020100010400f4,2,55,Thank you
I was trying to move my old cell phone number from my old carrier to a new cell phone carrier. The old carrier had a block on the old number. As a result I called multiple times and spent roughly 5 hours on the phone with multiple customer support folks. In the end NET10 was unable to unlock my old number. I filed multiple complaints and finally just left my old number with NET10,3,7,-4,58ba380f4cdfd90001778021,1,49,good question
