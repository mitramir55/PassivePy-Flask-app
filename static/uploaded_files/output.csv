"Abstract


A major goal of recent research in aging has been to examine cognitive plasticity in older adults and its capacity to counteract cognitive decline. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether older adults could benefit from brain training with video games in a cross-modal oddball task designed to assess distraction and alertness. Twenty-seven healthy older adults participated in the study (15 in the experimental group, 12 in the control group. The experimental group received 20 1-hr video game training sessions using a commercially available brain-training package (Lumosity) involving problem solving, mental calculation, working memory and attention tasks. The control group did not practice this package and, instead, attended meetings with the other members of the study several times along the course of the study. Both groups were evaluated before and after the intervention using a cross-modal oddball task measuring alertness and distraction. The results showed a significant reduction of distraction and an increase of alertness in the experimental group and no variation in the control group. These results suggest neurocognitive plasticity in the old human brain as training enhanced cognitive performance on attentional functions.

"Abstract


Adjuvant chemotherapy decisions in breast cancer are increasingly based on the pathologist's assessment of tumor proliferation. The Swiss Working Group of Gyneco- and Breast Pathologists has surveyed inter- and intraobserver consistency of Ki-67-based proliferative fraction in breast carcinomas.



Methods
Five pathologists evaluated MIB-1-labeling index (LI) in ten breast carcinomas (G1, G2, G3) by counting and eyeballing. In the same way, 15 pathologists all over Switzerland then assessed MIB-1-LI on three G2 carcinomas, in self-selected or pre-defined areas of the tumors, comparing centrally immunostained slides with slides immunostained in the different laboratoires. To study intra-observer variability, the same tumors were re-examined 4 months later.



Results
The Kappa values for the first series of ten carcinomas of various degrees of differentiation showed good to very good agreement for MIB-1-LI (Kappa 0.56–0.72). However, we found very high inter-observer variabilities (Kappa 0.04–0.14) in the read-outs of the G2 carcinomas. It was not possible to explain the inconsistencies exclusively by any of the following factors: (i) pathologists' divergent definitions of what counts as a positive nucleus (ii) the mode of assessment (counting vs. eyeballing), (iii) immunostaining technique, and (iv) the selection of the tumor area in which to count. Despite intensive confrontation of all participating pathologists with the problem, inter-observer agreement did not improve when the same slides were re-examined 4 months later (Kappa 0.01–0.04) and intra-observer agreement was likewise poor (Kappa 0.00–0.35).



Conclusion
Assessment of mid-range Ki-67-LI suffers from high inter- and intra-observer variability. Oncologists should be aware of this caveat when using Ki-67-LI as a basis for treatment decisions in moderately differentiated breast carcinomas.",11,"['were re', 'were re']",2,2,0.18181818181818182,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0037379,How Reliable Is Ki-67 Immunohistochemistry in Grade 2 Breast Carcinomas?

"Abstract


Age is a powerful predictor of survival in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) yet the biological basis for the difference in clinical outcome is mostly unknown. Discovering genes and pathways that would explain age-specific survival difference could generate opportunities for novel therapeutics for GBM. Here we have integrated gene expression, exon expression, microRNA expression, copy number alteration, SNP, whole exome sequence, and DNA methylation data sets of a cohort of GBM patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to discover age-specific signatures at the transcriptional, genetic, and epigenetic levels and validated our findings on the REMBRANDT data set. We found major age-specific signatures at all levels including age-specific hypermethylation in polycomb group protein target genes and the upregulation of angiogenesis-related genes in older GBMs. These age-specific differences in GBM, which are independent of molecular subtypes, may in part explain the preferential effects of anti-angiogenic agents in older GBM and pave the way to a better understanding of the unique biology and clinical behavior of older versus younger GBMs.",5,[],0,0,0.0,0,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062982,"Age-Specific Signatures of Glioblastoma at the Genomic, Genetic, and Epigenetic Levels"
"Abstract


Along with target amplification, distractor inhibition is regarded as a major contributor to selective attention. Some theories suggest that the strength of inhibitory processing is proportional to the salience of the distractor (i.e., inhibition reacts to the distractor intensity). Other theories suggest that the strength of inhibitory processing does not depend on the salience of the distractor (i.e., inhibition does not react to the distractor intensity). The present study aimed to elucidate the relationship between the intensity of a distractor and its subsequent inhibition during focused attention. A flanker task with a variable distractor-target stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) was used to measure both distractor interference and distractor inhibition. We manipulated the intensity of the distractor in two separate ways, by varying its distance from the target (Experiment 1) and by varying its brightness (Experiment 2). The results indicate that more intense distractors were associated with both increased interference and stronger distractor inhibition. The latter outcome provides novel support for the reactive inhibition hypothesis, which posits that inhibition reacts to the strength of distractor input, such that more salient distractors elicit stronger inhibition.",8,"['is regarded', 'was used']",2,2,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062809,Evidence Inhibition Responds Reactively to the Salience of Distracting Information during Focused Attention
"Abstract


Although brain injury after neonatal encephalopathy has been characterised well in high-income countries, little is known about such injury in low- and middle-income countries. Such injury accounts for an estimated 1 million neonatal deaths per year. We used magnetic resonance (MR) biomarkers to characterise perinatal brain injury, and examined early childhood outcomes in South India.



Methods
We recruited consecutive term or near term infants with evidence of perinatal asphyxia and a Thompson encephalopathy score ≥6 within 6 h of birth, over 6 months. We performed conventional MR imaging, diffusion tensor MR imaging and thalamic proton MR spectroscopy within 3 weeks of birth. We computed group-wise differences in white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) using tract based spatial statistics. We allocated Sarnat encephalopathy stage aged 3 days, and evaluated neurodevelopmental outcomes aged 3½ years using Bayley III.



Results
Of the 54 neonates recruited, Sarnat staging was mild in 30 (56%); moderate in 15 (28%) and severe in 6 (11%), with no encephalopathy in 3 (6%). Six infants died. Of the 48 survivors, 44 had images available for analysis. In these infants, imaging indicated perinatal rather than established antenatal origins to injury. Abnormalities were frequently observed in white matter (n = 40, 91%) and cortex (n = 31, 70%) while only 12 (27%) had abnormal basal ganglia/thalami. Reduced white matter FA was associated with Sarnat stage, deep grey nuclear injury, and MR spectroscopy N-acetylaspartate/choline, but not early Thompson scores. Outcome data were obtained in 44 infants (81%) with 38 (79%) survivors examined aged 3½ years; of these, 16 (42%) had adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.



Conclusions
No infants had evidence for established brain lesions, suggesting potentially treatable perinatal origins. White matter injury was more common than deep brain nuclei injury. Our results support the need for rigorous evaluation of the efficacy of rescue hypothermic neuroprotection in low- and middle-income countries.",17,"['has been characterised', 'is known', 'were frequently observed', 'were obtained']",4,3,0.17647058823529413,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0087874,Neonatal Encephalopathic Cerebral Injury in South India Assessed by Perinatal Magnetic Resonance Biomarkers and Early Childhood Neurodevelopmental Outcome
"Abstract


Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia. The clinical symptoms of AD begin with impairment of memory and executive function followed by the gradual involvement of other functions, such as language, semantic knowledge, abstract thinking, attention, and visuospatial abilities. Visuospatial function involves the identification of a stimulus and its location and can be impaired at the beginning of AD. The Visual Object and Space Perception (VOSP) battery evaluates visuospatial function, while minimizing the interference of other cognitive functions.



Objectives
To evaluate visuospatial function in early AD patients using the VOSP and determine cutoff scores to differentiate between cognitively healthy individuals and AD patients.



Methods
Thirty-one patients with mild AD and forty-four healthy elderly were evaluated using a neuropsychological battery and the VOSP.



Results
In the VOSP, the AD patients performed more poorly in all subtests examining object perception and in two subtests examining space perception (Number Location and Cube Analysis). The VOSP showed good accuracy and good correlation with tests measuring visuospatial function.



Conclusion
Visuospatial function is impaired in the early stages of AD. The VOSP battery is a sensitive battery test for visuospatial deficits with minimal interference by other cognitive functions.",10,"['followed by the gradual involvement of other functions, such as language', 'can be impaired', 'were evaluated']",3,3,0.3,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0068398,Visuospatial Function in Early Alzheimer’s Disease—The Use of the Visual Object and Space Perception (VOSP) Battery
"Abstract


Antidepressants represent the standard treatment for major depression. However, their efficacy is variable and incomplete. A growing number of studies suggest that the environment plays a major role in determining the efficacy of these drugs, specifically of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). A recent hypothesis posits that the increase in serotonin levels induced by SSRI may not affect mood per se, but enhances neural plasticity and, consequently, renders the individual more susceptible to the influence of the environment. Thus, SSRI administration in a favorable environment would lead to a reduction of symptoms, while in a stressful environment might lead to a worse prognosis. To test this hypothesis, we treated C57BL/6 adult male mice with chronic fluoxetine while exposing them to either (i) an enriched environment, after exposure to a chronic stress period aimed at inducing a depression-like phenotype, or (ii) a stressful environment. Anhedonia, brain BDNF and circulating corticosterone levels, considered endophenotypes of depression, were investigated. Mice treated with fluoxetine in an enriched condition improved their depression-like phenotype compared to controls, displaying higher saccharin preference, higher brain BDNF levels and reduced corticosterone levels. By contrast, when chronic fluoxetine administration occurred in a stressful condition, mice showed a more distinct worsening of the depression-like profile, displaying a faster decrease of saccharin preference, lower brain BDNF levels and increased corticosterone levels. Our findings suggest that the effect of SSRI on depression-like phenotypes in mice is not determined by the drug per se but is induced by the drug and driven by the environment. These findings may be helpful to explain variable effects of SSRI found in clinical practice and to device strategies aimed at enhancing their efficacy by means of controlling environmental conditions.",10,"['were investigated', 'is not determined', 'is induced']",3,2,0.2,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062226,Antidepressant Treatment Outcome Depends on the Quality of the Living Environment: A Pre-Clinical Investigation in Mice
"Abstract


Anxiety is common in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), with specific fears and phobias one of the most frequent subtypes. Specific fears and phobias can have a serious impact on young people with ASD and their families. In this study we developed and evaluated a unique treatment combining cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) with graduated exposure in a virtual reality environment (VRE). Nine verbally fluent boys with an ASD diagnosis and no reported learning disability, aged 7 to 13 years old, were recruited. Each had anxiety around a specific situation (e.g. crowded buses) or stimulus (e.g. pigeons). An individualised scene was recreated in our ‘wrap-around’ VRE. In the VRE participants were coached by a psychologist in cognitive and behavioural techniques (e.g. relaxation and breathing exercises) while the exposure to the phobia/fear stimulus was gradually increased as the child felt ready. Each child received four 20–30 minute sessions. After participating in the study, eight of the nine children were able to tackle their phobia situation. Four of the participants completely overcame their phobia. Treatment effects were maintained at 12 months. These results provide evidence that CBT with VRE can be a highly effective treatment for specific phobia/fear for some young people with ASD.

"Abstract


Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients have both working memory (WM) and attention problems. Good attention skills are important for WM performance; individuals have higher WM capacity when being able to prevent storage of irrelevant information through efficient filtering. Since it is unknown how filtering ability is associated with WM performance in ADHD, this was investigated in the present study. A visuospatial working memory (VSWM) change detection task with distracting stimuli was administered to adolescents (12–16 years old) and adults (20–46 years old) with and without ADHD matched on education/IQ. Besides performance, contralateral delay activity (CDA) was measured; a neural correlate of the number of targets and distracters encoded and maintained in WM during the retention interval. Performance data showed similar WM-load, WM-distracter interference and developmental effects in ADHD and control groups. Adolescents’ performance on the WM task deteriorated more than that of adults in the presence of distracters and with higher WM-load, irrespective of Diagnosis. The CDA data suggested that initially all groups encoded/maintained distracting information, but only adults were able to bounce this information from memory later in the retention interval, leading to better WM performance. The only effect of Diagnosis was a smaller CDA in adolescents and adults with ADHD than in age/IQ-matched controls when maintaining a low 1-item load, which was possibly related to an inability to keep attention focused at cued stimuli with low task demands. Overall, the development of filtering efficiency and VSWM storage capacity in adolescents with ADHD was not different from that in typically developing peers.",10,"['was investigated', 'was administered', 'was measured', 'was possibly related']",4,4,0.4,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062673,No Behavioral or ERP Evidence for a Developmental Lag in Visual Working Memory Capacity or Filtering in Adolescents and Adults with ADHD
"Abstract


Background
Intimate partner violence (IPV) around the time of pregnancy is a widespread global health problem with many negative consequences. Nevertheless, a lot remains unclear about which interventions are effective and might be adopted in the perinatal care context.



Objective
The objective is to provide a clear overview of the existing evidence on effectiveness of interventions for IPV around the time of pregnancy.



Methods
Following databases PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched and expanded by hand search. The search was limited to English peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials published from 2000 to 2013. This review includes all types of interventions aiming to reduce IPV around the time of pregnancy as a primary outcome, and as secondary outcomes to enhance physical and/or mental health, quality of life, safety behavior, help seeking behavior, and/or social support.



Results
We found few randomized controlled trials evaluating interventions for IPV around the time of pregnancy. Moreover, the nine studies identified did not produce strong evidence that certain interventions are effective. Nonetheless, home visitation programs and some multifaceted counseling interventions did produce promising results. Five studies reported a statistically significant decrease in physical, sexual and/or psychological partner violence (odds ratios from 0.47 to 0.92). Limited evidence was found for improved mental health, less postnatal depression, improved quality of life, fewer subsequent miscarriages, and less low birth weight/prematurity. None of the studies reported any evidence of a negative or harmful effect of the interventions.



Conclusions and implications
Strong evidence of effective interventions for IPV during the perinatal period is lacking, but some interventions show promising results. Additional large-scale, high-quality research is essential to provide further evidence about the effect of certain interventions and clarify which interventions should be adopted in the perinatal care context.",15,"['might be adopted', 'were systematically searched and expanded by', 'was limited', 'was found', 'should be adopted']",5,5,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085084,Intimate Partner Violence and Pregnancy: A Systematic Review of Interventions

Background
It is unknown if changes in the gene expression of the desaturase and elongase enzymes are associated with abnormal n-6 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) levels in children with atopic eczema (AE). We analyzed whether mRNA-expression of genes encoding key enzymes of LC-PUFA synthesis (FADS1, FADS2 and ELOVL5) is associated with circulating LC-PUFA levels and risk of AE in 4-year-old children.



Methods
AE (n=20) and non-AE (n=104) children participating in the Sabadell cohort within the INfancia y Medio Ambiente (INMA) Project were included in the present study. RT-PCR with TaqMan Low-Density Array cards was used to measure the mRNA-expression of FADS1, FADS2 and ELOVL5. LC-PUFA levels were measured by fast gas chromatography in plasma phospholipids. The relationship of gene expression with LC-PUFA levels and enzyme activities was evaluated by Pearson’s rank correlation coefficient, and logistic regression models were used to study its association with risk of developing AE.



Results
Children with AE had lower levels of several n-6 PUFA members, dihomo-γ-linolenic (DGLA) and arachidonic (AA) acids. mRNA-expression levels of FADS1 and 2 strongly correlated with DGLA levels and with D6D activity. FADS2 and ELOVL5 mRNA-expression levels were significantly lower in AE than in non-AE children (-40.30% and -20.36%; respectively), but no differences were found for FADS1.



Conclusions and Significance
Changes in the mRNA-expression levels of FADS1 and 2 directly affect blood DGLA levels and D6D activity. This study suggests that lower mRNA-expressions of FADS2 and ELOVL5 are associated with higher risk of atopic eczema in young children.",12,"['were included', 'was used', 'were measured', 'was evaluated', 'were used', 'were found']",6,5,0.4166666666666667,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0078245,Gene Expression of Desaturase (FADS1 and FADS2) and Elongase (ELOVL5) Enzymes in Peripheral Blood: Association with Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Levels and Atopic Eczema in 4-Year-Old Children
"Abstract


Background
Microglia of the central nervous system act as sentinels and rapidly react to infection or inflammation. The pathophysiological role of bone marrow-derived microglia is of particular interest because they affect neurodegenerative disorders and neuropathic pain. The hypothesis of the current study is that chronic psychological stress (chronic PS) induces the infiltration of bone marrow-derived microglia into hypothalamus by means of chemokine axes in brain and bone marrow.



Methods and Findings
Here we show that bone marrow-derived microglia specifically infiltrate the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of mice that received chronic PS. Bone marrow derived-microglia are CX3CR1lowCCR2+CXCR4high, as distinct from CX3CR1highCCR2-CXCR4low resident microglia, and express higher levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) but lower levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Chronic PS stimulates the expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in PVN neurons, reduces stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in the bone marrow and increases the frequency of CXCR4+ monocytes in peripheral circulation. And then a chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) or a β3-adrenoceptor blockade prevents infiltration of bone marrow-derived microglia in the PVN.



Conclusion
Chronic PS induces the infiltration of bone marrow-derived microglia into PVN, and it is conceivable that the MCP-1/CCR2 axis in PVN and the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in bone marrow are involved in this mechanism.",8,[],0,0,0.0,0,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081744,Bone Marrow-Derived Microglia Infiltrate into the Paraventricular Nucleus of Chronic Psychological Stress-Loaded Mice
"Abstract


Biases in attention processes are thought to play a crucial role in the aetiology and maintenance of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). The goal of the present study was to examine the efficacy of a programme intended to train attention towards positive cues and a programme intended to train attention towards negative cues. In a randomised, controlled, double-blind design, the impact of these two training conditions on both selective attention and social anxiety were compared to that of a control training condition. A modified dot probe task was used, and delivered via the internet. A total of 129 individuals, diagnosed with SAD, were randomly assigned to one of these three conditions and took part in a 14-day programme with daily training/control sessions. Participants in all three groups did not on average display an attentional bias prior to the training. Critically, results on change in attention bias implied that significantly differential change in selective attention to threat was not detected in the three conditions. However, symptoms of social anxiety reduced significantly from pre- to follow-up-assessment in all three conditions (dwithin  = 0.63–1.24), with the procedure intended to train attention towards threat cues producing, relative to the control condition, a significantly greater reduction of social fears. There were no significant differences in social anxiety outcome between the training condition intended to induce attentional bias towards positive cues and the control condition. To our knowledge, this is the first RCT where a condition intended to induce attention bias to negative cues yielded greater emotional benefits than a control condition. Intriguingly, changes in symptoms are unlikely to be by the mechanism of change in attention processes since there was no change detected in bias per se. Implications of this finding for future research on attention bias modification in social anxiety are discussed.

Chronic neck pain is a major public health problem with very few evidence-based complementary treatment options. This study aimed to test the efficacy of 12 weeks of a partner-delivered home-based cupping massage, compared to the same period of progressive muscle relaxation in patients with chronic non-specific neck pain. Patients were randomly assigned to self-directed cupping massage or progressive muscle relaxation. They were trained and asked to undertake the assigned treatment twice weekly for 12 weeks. Primary outcome measure was the current neck pain intensity (0–100 mm visual analog scale; VAS) after 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included pain on motion, affective pain perception, functional disability, psychological distress, wellbeing, health-related quality of life, pressure pain thresholds and adverse events. Sixty one patients (54.1±12.7 years; 73.8%female) were randomized to cupping massage (n = 30) or progressive muscle relaxation (n = 31). After treatment, both groups showed significantly less pain compared to baseline however without significant group differences. Significant effects in favor of cupping massage were only found for wellbeing and pressure pain thresholds. In conclusion, cupping massage is no more effective than progressive muscle relaxation in reducing chronic non-specific neck pain. Both therapies can be easily used at home and can reduce pain to a minimal clinically relevant extent. Cupping massage may however be better than PMR in improving well-being and decreasing pressure pain sensitivity but more studies with larger samples and longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm these results.

Cognitive decline in aging is a pressing issue associated with significant healthcare costs and deterioration in quality of life. Previously, we reported the successful use of a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) training system in improving symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Here, we examine the feasibility of the BCI system with a new game that incorporates memory training in improving memory and attention in a pilot sample of healthy elderly. This study investigates the safety, usability and acceptability of our BCI system to elderly, and obtains an efficacy estimate to warrant a phase III trial. Thirty-one healthy elderly were randomized into intervention (n = 15) and waitlist control arms (n = 16). Intervention consisted of an 8-week training comprising 24 half-hour sessions. A usability and acceptability questionnaire was administered at the end of training. Safety was investigated by querying users about adverse events after every session. Efficacy of the system was measured by the change of total score from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) before and after training. Feedback on the usability and acceptability questionnaire was positive. No adverse events were reported for all participants across all sessions. Though the median difference in the RBANS change scores between arms was not statistically significant, an effect size of 0.6SD was obtained, which reflects potential clinical utility according to Simon’s randomized phase II trial design. Pooled data from both arms also showed that the median change in total scores pre and post-training was statistically significant (Mdn = 4.0; p<0.001). Specifically, there were significant improvements in immediate memory (p = 0.038), visuospatial/constructional (p = 0.014), attention (p = 0.039), and delayed memory (p<0.001) scores. Our BCI-based system shows promise in improving memory and attention in healthy elderly, and appears to be safe, user-friendly and acceptable to senior users. Given the efficacy signal, a phase III trial is warranted.

"Abstract


Cross-modal plasticity refers to the recruitment of cortical regions involved in the processing of one modality (e.g. vision) for processing other modalities (e.g. audition). The principles determining how and where cross-modal plasticity occurs remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate these principles by testing responses to auditory motion in visual motion area MT+ of congenitally blind and sighted individuals. Replicating previous reports, we find that MT+ as a whole shows a strong and selective responses to auditory motion in congenitally blind but not sighted individuals, suggesting that the emergence of this univariate response depends on experience. Importantly, however, multivoxel pattern analyses showed that MT+ contained information about different auditory motion conditions in both blind and sighted individuals. These results were specific to MT+ and not found in early visual cortex. Basic sensitivity to auditory motion in MT+ is thus experience-independent, which may be a basis for the region's strong cross-modal recruitment in congenital blindness.",7,['remain poorly understood'],1,1,0.14285714285714285,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063198,Multivoxel Pattern Analysis Reveals Auditory Motion Information in MT+ of Both Congenitally Blind and Sighted Individuals
"Abstract


Current assessment of visual neglect involves paper-and-pencil tests or computer-based tasks. Both have been criticised because of their lack of ecological validity as target stimuli can only be presented in a restricted visual range. This study examined the user-friendliness and diagnostic strength of a new “Circle-Monitor” (CM), which enlarges the range of the peripersonal space, in comparison to a standard paper-and-pencil test (Neglect-Test, NET).



Methods
Ten stroke patients with neglect and ten age-matched healthy controls were examined by the NET and the CM test comprising of four subtests (Star Cancellation, Line Bisection, Dice Task, and Puzzle Test).



Results
The acceptance of the CM in elderly controls and neglect patients was high. Participants rated the examination by CM as clear, safe and more enjoyable than NET. Healthy controls performed at ceiling on all subtests, without any systematic differences between the visual fields. Both NET and CM revealed significant differences between controls and patients in Line Bisection, Star Cancellation and visuo-constructive tasks (NET: Figure Copying, CM: Puzzle Test). Discriminant analyses revealed cross-validated assignment of patients and controls to groups was more precise when based on the CM (hit rate 90%) as compared to the NET (hit rate 70%).



Conclusion
The CM proved to be a sensitive novel tool to diagnose visual neglect symptoms quickly and accurately with superior diagnostic validity compared to a standard neglect test while being well accepted by patients. Due to its upgradable functions the system may also be a valuable tool not only to test for non-visual neglect symptoms, but also to provide treatment and assess its outcome.",11,"['have been criticised', 'be presented', 'were examined', 'being well accepted']",4,3,0.2727272727272727,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082892,A Circle-Monitor for Computerised Assessment of Visual Neglect in Peripersonal Space
"Abstract


Endometriosis is considered as a benign aseptic inflammatory disease, characterised by the presence of ectopic endometrium-like tissue. Its symptoms (mostly pain and infertility) are reported as constant stressors. Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and urocortin (UCN) are neuropeptides, strongly related to stress and inflammation. The effects of CRH and UCN are mediated through CRHR1 and CRHR2 receptors which are implicated in several reproductive functions acting as inflammatory components. However, the involvement of these molecules to endometriosis remains unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the expression of CRHR1 and CRHR2 in endometriotic sites and to compare the expression of CRHR1 and CRHR2 in eutopic endometrium of endometriotic women to that of healthy women. We further compared the expression of CRH, UCN, CRHR1 and CRHR2 in ectopic endometrium to that in eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. Endometrial biopsy specimens were taken from healthy women (10 patients) and endometrial and endometriotic biopsy specimens were taken from women with endometriosis (16 patients). Τhe expression of CRH, UCN, CRHR1, and CRHR2 was tested via RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. This study shows for the first time that CRH and UCN receptor subtypes CRHR1β and CRHR2α are expressed in endometriotic sites and that they are more strongly expressed (p<0.01) in eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis compared to healthy women endometrium at the mRNA and protein level. CRH, UCN, CRHR1 and CRHR2 mRNA were also more highly expressed in ectopic rather than eutopic endometrium (CRH, UCN, CRHR2α: p<0.01, CRHR1β: p<0.05) and protein (CRH and UCN: p<0.05, CRHR1 and CRHR2: p<0.01) in women with endometriosis. These data indicate that CRH and UCN might play an immunoregulatory role in endometriotic sites by affecting reproductive functions such as decidualization and implantation of women with endometriosis.",12,"['is considered', 'are reported', 'are mediated', 'are implicated', 'were taken', 'were taken', 'was tested', 'are expressed']",8,6,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062313,"Differential Expression of CRH, UCN, CRHR1 and CRHR2 in Eutopic and Ectopic Endometrium of Women with Endometriosis"
"Abstract


Evidence for the effectiveness of patient education programmes in changing individual self-management behaviour is equivocal. More distal elements of personal social relationships and the availability of social capital at the community level may be key to the mobilisation of resources needed for long-term condition self-management to be effective.



Aim
To determine how the social networks of people with long-term conditions (diabetes and heart disease) are associated with health-related outcomes and changes in outcomes over time.



Methods
Patients with chronic heart disease (CHD) or diabetes (n = 300) randomly selected from the disease registers of 19 GP practices in the North West of England. Data on personal social networks collected using a postal questionnaire, alongside face-to-face interviewing. Follow-up at 12 months via postal questionnaire using a self-report grid for network members identified at baseline.



Analysis
Multiple regression analysis of relationships between health status, self-management and health-economics outcomes, and characteristics of patients' social networks.



Results
Findings indicated that: (1) social involvement with a wider variety of people and groups supports personal self-management and physical and mental well-being; (2) support work undertaken by personal networks expands in accordance with health needs helping people to cope with their condition; (3) network support substitutes for formal care and can produce substantial saving in traditional health service utilisation costs. Health service costs were significantly (p<0.01) reduced for patients receiving greater levels of illness work through their networks.



Conclusions
Support for self-management which achieves desirable policy outcomes should be construed less as an individualised set of actions and behaviour and more as a social network phenomenon. This study shows the need for a greater focus on harnessing and sustaining the capacity of networks and the importance of social involvement with community groups and resources for producing a more desirable and cost-effective way of supporting long term illness management.",11,['should be construed'],1,1,0.09090909090909091,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098340,The Contribution of Social Networks to the Health and Self-Management of Patients with Long-Term Conditions: A Longitudinal Study
"Abstract


Fear conditioning and extinction are basic forms of associative learning that have gained considerable clinical relevance in enhancing our understanding of anxiety disorders and facilitating their treatment. Modern neuroimaging techniques have significantly aided the identification of anatomical structures and networks involved in fear conditioning. On closer inspection, there is considerable variation in methodology and results between studies. This systematic review provides an overview of the current neuroimaging literature on fear conditioning and extinction on healthy subjects, taking into account methodological issues such as the conditioning paradigm.
A Pubmed search, as of December 2008, was performed and supplemented by manual searches of bibliographies of key articles. Two independent reviewers made the final study selection and data extraction. A total of 46 studies on cued fear conditioning and/or extinction on healthy volunteers using positron emission tomography or functional magnetic resonance imaging were reviewed. The influence of specific experimental factors, such as contingency and timing parameters, assessment of conditioned responses, and characteristics of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli, on cerebral activation patterns was examined. Results were summarized descriptively. A network consisting of fear-related brain areas, such as amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex, is activated independently of design parameters. However, some neuroimaging studies do not report these findings in the presence of methodological heterogeneities. Furthermore, other brain areas are differentially activated, depending on specific design parameters. These include stronger hippocampal activation in trace conditioning and tactile stimulation. Furthermore, tactile unconditioned stimuli enhance activation of pain related, motor, and somatosensory areas.
Differences concerning experimental factors may partly explain the variance between neuroimaging investigations on human fear conditioning and extinction and should, therefore, be taken into serious consideration in the planning and the interpretation of research projects.",14,"['was performed and supplemented by', 'were reviewed', 'was examined', 'were summarized', 'is activated', 'are differentially activated', 'be taken']",7,7,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005865,Human Fear Conditioning and Extinction in Neuroimaging: A Systematic Review
"Abstract


Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in the midbrain at 7 Tesla suffers from unexpectedly low temporal signal to noise ratio (TSNR) compared to other brain regions. Various methodologies were used in this study to quantitatively identify causes of the noise and signal differences in midbrain fMRI data. The influence of physiological noise sources was examined using RETROICOR, phase regression analysis, and power spectral analyses of contributions in the respiratory and cardiac frequency ranges. The impact of between-shot phase shifts in 3-D multi-shot sequences was tested using a one-dimensional (1-D) phase navigator approach. Additionally, the effects of shared noise influences between regions that were temporally, but not functionally, correlated with the midbrain (adjacent white matter and anterior cerebellum) were investigated via analyses with regressors of ‘no interest’. These attempts to reduce noise did not improve the overall TSNR in the midbrain. In addition, the steady state signal and noise were measured in the midbrain and the visual cortex for resting state data. We observed comparable steady state signals from both the midbrain and the cortex. However, the noise was 2–3 times higher in the midbrain relative to the cortex, confirming that the low TSNR in the midbrain was not due to low signal but rather a result of large signal variance. These temporal variations did not behave as known physiological or other noise sources, and were not mitigated by conventional strategies. Upon further investigation, resting state functional connectivity analysis in the midbrain showed strong intrinsic fluctuations between homologous midbrain regions. These data suggest that the low TSNR in the midbrain may originate from larger signal fluctuations arising from functional connectivity compared to cortex, rather than simply reflecting physiological noise.",11,"['were used', 'was examined', 'was tested', 'were investigated', 'were measured', 'were not mitigated']",6,6,0.5454545454545454,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062708,On the Origins of Signal Variance in FMRI of the Human Midbrain at High Field

In studies of schizotypy, investigators seldom inform participants that they are engaged in research designed to shed light on risk for schizophrenia. Such nondisclosure is justified in part by the argument that disclosure of risk status may be harmful. However, there is little evidence that this is the case. Harm arising from disclosure of risk status was examined in two experiments. In the first, participants (n = 114 psychology undergraduates) were asked to anticipate their reactions to news of risk for schizophrenia, depression, cancer, and diabetes, and also to indicate whether they would want to know their schizophrenia risk status. Participants anticipated schizophrenia risk would have a negative impact that was significantly greater than depression or diabetes risk but similar to cancer risk. The anticipated impact of schizophrenia risk was predicted by expectations of stigmatization as well as confidence in the accuracy of biological screening. Although 81% indicated a preference for knowing their risk status, just 11% were prepared to undergo an assessment to find out. In the second, a between-subjects deception paradigm was used to inform participants (n = 144 psychology undergraduates) they had an enzyme deficiency that placed them at increased risk for schizophrenia, cancer, or depression. Impact was assessed using prospective self-report and salivary cortisol and retrospective self-report. Impact was modeled using measures of stigmatization and health locus of control. Retrospectively, schizophrenia, cancer, and depression risk had strong negative impacts relative to a control group, but there was no effect on prospective measures. Together, the findings suggest that news of risk for schizophrenia has the potential to engender distress, although participants’ anticipations and reflections of responses are not corroborated in prospectively measured outcomes.",13,"['are engaged', 'is justified', 'was examined', 'were asked', 'was predicted', 'was used', 'was assessed', 'was modeled', 'are not corroborated']",9,9,0.6923076923076923,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062904,The Impact and Desirability of News of Risk for Schizophrenia
"Abstract


In the animal kingdom, camouflage refers to patterns that help potential prey avoid detection. Mostly camouflage is thought of as helping prey blend in with their background. In contrast, disruptive or dazzle patterns protect moving targets and have been suggested as an evolutionary force in shaping the dorsal patterns of animals. Dazzle patterns, such as stripes and zigzags, are thought to reduce the probability with which moving prey will be captured by impairing predators' perception of speed. We investigated how different patterns of stripes (longitudinal—i.e., parallel to movement direction–and vertical–i.e., perpendicular to movement direction) affect the probability with which humans can hit moving objects and if differences in hitting probability are caused by a misperception of speed. A first experiment showed that longitudinally striped objects were hit more often than unicolored objects. However, vertically striped objects did not differ from unicolored objects. A second study examining the link between perceived speed and hitting probability showed that longitudinally and vertically striped objects were both perceived as moving faster and were hit more often than unicolored objects. In sum, our results provide evidence that striped patterns disrupt the perception of speed, which in turn influences how often objects are hit. However, the magnitude and the direction of the effects depend on additional factors such as speed and the task setup.",10,"['is thought', 'have been suggested', 'are thought', 'will be captured', 'are caused', 'were hit', 'were hit', 'are hit']",8,7,0.7,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0061173,Are Stripes Beneficial?

"Abstract


It is well-kown that sensory information influences the way we execute motor responses. However, less is known about if and how sensory and motor information are integrated in the subsequent process of response evaluation. We used a modified Simon Task to investigate how these streams of information are integrated in response evaluation processes, applying an in-depth neurophysiological analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs), time-frequency decomposition and sLORETA. The results show that response evaluation processes are differentially modulated by afferent proprioceptive information and efference copies. While the influence of proprioceptive information is mediated via oscillations in different frequency bands, efference copy based information about the motor execution is specifically mediated via oscillations in the theta frequency band. Stages of visual perception and attention were not modulated by the interaction of proprioception and motor efference copies. Brain areas modulated by the interactive effects of proprioceptive and efference copy based information included the middle frontal gyrus and the supplementary motor area (SMA), suggesting that these areas integrate sensory information for the purpose of response evaluation. The results show how motor response evaluation processes are modulated by information about both the execution and the location of a response.",8,"['is known', 'are integrated', 'are integrated', 'are differentially modulated', 'is mediated', 'is specifically mediated', 'were not modulated', 'are modulated']",8,6,0.75,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062335,Differential Effects of Motor Efference Copies and Proprioceptive Information on Response Evaluation Processes

Malnutrition is a frequent condition in elderly people, especially in nursing homes and geriatric wards. Its frequency is less well known among elderly living at home. The objective of this study was to describe the nutritional status evaluated by the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) of elderly community-dwellers living in rural and urban areas in France and to investigate its associated factors.



Methods
Subjects aged 65 years and over from the Approche Multidisciplinaire Intégrée (AMI) cohort (692 subjects living in a rural area) and the Three-City (3C) cohort (8,691 subjects living in three large urban zones) were included. A proxy version of the MNA was reconstructed using available data from the AMI cohort. Sensitivity and specificity were used to evaluate the agreement between the proxy version and the standard version in AMI. The proxy MNA was computed in both cohorts to evaluate the frequency of poor nutritional status. Factors associated with this state were investigated in each cohort separately.



Results
In the rural sample, 38.0% were females and the mean age was 75.5 years. In the urban sample, 60.3% were females and the mean age was 74.1 years. Among subjects in living in the rural sample, 7.4% were in poor nutritional status while the proportion was 18.5% in the urban sample. Female gender, older age, being widowed, a low educational level, low income, low body mass index, being demented, having a depressive symptomatology, a loss of autonomy and an intake of more than 3 drugs appeared to be independently associated with poor nutritional status.



Conclusion
Poor nutritional status was commonly observed among elderly people living at home in both rural and urban areas. The associated factors should be further considered for targeting particularly vulnerable individuals.",14,"['subjects aged', 'were included', 'was reconstructed', 'were used', 'was computed', 'were investigated', 'being widowed', 'was commonly observed', 'should be further considered']",9,8,0.5714285714285714,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0105137,Nutritional Status in Community-Dwelling Elderly in France in Urban and Rural Areas
"Abstract


Music has pain-relieving effects, but its mechanisms remain unclear. We sought to verify previously studied analgesic components and further elucidate the underpinnings of music analgesia. Using a well-characterized conditioning-enhanced placebo model, we examined whether boosting expectations would enhance or interfere with analgesia from strongly preferred music. A two-session experiment was performed with 48 healthy, pain experiment-naïve participants. In a first cohort, 36 were randomized into 3 treatment groups, including music enhanced with positive expectancy, non-musical sound enhanced with positive expectancy, and no expectancy enhancement. A separate replication cohort of 12 participants received only expectancy-enhanced music following the main experiment to verify the results of expectancy-manipulation on music. Primary outcome measures included the change in subjective pain ratings to calibrated experimental noxious heat stimuli, as well as changes in treatment expectations. Without conditioning, expectations were strongly in favor of music compared to non-musical sound. While measured expectations were enhanced by conditioning, this failed to affect either music or sound analgesia significantly. Strongly preferred music on its own was as pain relieving as conditioning-enhanced strongly preferred music, and more analgesic than enhanced sound. Our results demonstrate the pain-relieving power of personal music even over enhanced expectations.

Objective Previous studies on developmental trajectories have used ad hoc definitions of oppositional defiant behaviors (ODB), which makes it difficult to compare results. This article defines developmental trajectories of ODB from ages 3–5 based on five different standard measurements derived from three separate instruments.



Method
A sample of 622 three-year-old preschoolers, followed up at ages 4, 5, and 6, was assessed with the five measures of oppositionality answered by parents and teachers. Growth-Mixture-Modeling (GMM) estimated separate developmental trajectories for each ODB measure for ages 3 to 5.



Results
The number of classes-trajectories obtained in each GMM depended on the ODB measure, but two clear patterns emerged: four trajectories (persistent low, decreasers, increasers/high increasers, persistent moderate/persistent high) or three trajectories (persistent low, decreasers, increasers/high increasers). Persistent high trajectories accounted for 4.4%–9.5% of the children. The trajectories emerging from the different ODB measures at ages 3 to 5 discriminated disruptive disorders, comorbidity, use of services, and impairment at age 6, and globally showed a similar pattern, summarizing longitudinal information on oppositionality in preschool children in a similar way.



Conclusions
Trajectories resulting from standard scales of the questionnaires have predictive validity for identifying relevant clinical outcomes, but are measure-specific. The results contribute to knowledge about the development of ODB in preschool children.",9,['was assessed'],1,1,0.1111111111111111,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101089,Tracing Developmental Trajectories of Oppositional Defiant Behaviors in Preschool Children
"Abstract


Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are frequently co-morbid, and dysfunctional frontal-striatal circuits have been implicated in both disorders. Neurobiological distinctions between OCD and MDD are insufficiently clear, and comparative neuroimaging studies are extremely scarce. OCD and MDD may be characterized by cognitive rigidity at the phenotype level, and frontal-striatal brain circuits constitute the neural substrate of intact cognitive flexibility. In the present study, 18 non-medicated MDD-free patients with OCD, 19 non-medicated OCD-free patients with MDD, and 29 matched healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during performance of a self-paced letter/digit task switching paradigm. Results showed that both patient groups responded slower relative to controls during repeat events, but only in OCD patients slowing was associated with decreased error rates. During switching, patients with OCD showed increased activation of the putamen, anterior cingulate and insula, whereas MDD patients recruited inferior parietal cortex and precuneus to a lesser extent. Patients with OCD and MDD commonly failed to reveal anterior prefrontal cortex activation during switching. This study shows subtle behavioral abnormalities on a measure of cognitive flexibility in MDD and OCD, associated with differential frontal-striatal brain dysfunction in both disorders. These findings may add to the development of biological markers that more precisely characterize frequently co-morbid neuropsychiatric disorders such as OCD and MDD.",8,"['have been implicated', 'may be characterized']",2,2,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0059600,Cognitive Inflexibility in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Major Depression Is Associated with Distinct Neural Correlates

One of the goals in neuroscience is to obtain tractable laboratory cultures that closely recapitulate in vivo systems while still providing ease of use in the lab. Because neurons can exist in the body over a lifetime, long-term culture systems are necessary so as to closely mimic the physiological conditions under laboratory culture conditions. Ideally, such a neuronal organoid culture would contain multiple cell types, be highly differentiated, and have a high density of interconnected cells. However, before these types of cultures can be created, certain problems associated with long-term neuronal culturing must be addressed. We sought to develop a new protocol which may further prolong the duration and integrity of E18 rat hippocampal cultures. We have developed a protocol that allows for culturing of E18 hippocampal neurons at high densities for more than 120 days. These cultured hippocampal neurons are (i) well differentiated with high numbers of synapses, (ii) anchored securely to their substrate, (iii) have high levels of functional connectivity, and (iv) form dense multi-layered cellular networks. We propose that our culture methodology is likely to be effective for multiple neuronal subtypes–particularly those that can be grown in Neurobasal/B27 media. This methodology presents new avenues for long-term functional studies in neurons.",7,"['can be created', 'must be addressed', 'can be grown']",3,2,0.2857142857142857,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0058996,Towards Neuronal Organoids: A Method for Long-Term Culturing of High-Density Hippocampal Neurons
"Abstract


Online social media are increasingly facilitating our social interactions, thereby making available a massive “digital fossil” of human behavior. Discovering and quantifying distinct patterns using these data is important for studying social behavior, although the rapid time-variant nature and large volumes of these data make this task difficult and challenging. In this study, we focused on the emergence of “collective attention” on Twitter, a popular social networking service. We propose a simple method for detecting and measuring the collective attention evoked by various types of events. This method exploits the fact that tweeting activity exhibits a burst-like increase and an irregular oscillation when a particular real-world event occurs; otherwise, it follows regular circadian rhythms. The difference between regular and irregular states in the tweet stream was measured using the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which corresponds to the intensity of collective attention. We then associated irregular incidents with their corresponding events that attracted the attention and elicited responses from large numbers of people, based on the popularity and the enhancement of key terms in posted messages or “tweets.” Next, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this method using a large dataset that contained approximately 490 million Japanese tweets by over 400,000 users, in which we identified 60 cases of collective attentions, including one related to the Tohoku-oki earthquake. “Retweet” networks were also investigated to understand collective attention in terms of social interactions. This simple method provides a retrospective summary of collective attention, thereby contributing to the fundamental understanding of social behavior in the digital era.",10,"['was measured', 'were also investigated']",2,2,0.2,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0061823,Quantifying Collective Attention from Tweet Stream

People are often called upon to witness, and to empathize with, the pain and suffering of others. In the current study, we directly compared neural responses to others' physical pain and emotional suffering by presenting participants (n = 41) with 96 verbal stories, each describing a protagonist's physical and/or emotional experience, ranging from neutral to extremely negative. A separate group of participants rated “how much physical pain”, and “how much emotional suffering” the protagonist experienced in each story, as well as how “vivid and movie-like” the story was. Although ratings of Pain, Suffering and Vividness were positively correlated with each other across stories, item-analyses revealed that each scale was correlated with activity in distinct brain regions. Even within regions of the “Shared Pain network” identified using a separate data set, responses to others' physical pain and emotional suffering were distinct. More broadly, item analyses with continuous predictors provided a high-powered method for identifying brain regions associated with specific aspects of complex stimuli – like verbal descriptions of physical and emotional events.",6,"['are often called', 'were positively correlated', 'was correlated']",3,2,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063085,How We Know It Hurts: Item Analysis of Written Narratives Reveals Distinct Neural Responses to Others' Physical Pain and Emotional Suffering

Perception of novel objects is of enormous importance in our lives. People have to perceive or understand novel objects when seeing an original painting, admiring an unconventional construction, and using an inventive device. However, very little is known about neural mechanisms underlying the perception for novel objects. Perception of novel objects relies on the integration of unusual features of novel objects in order to identify what such objects are. In the present study, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was employed to investigate neural correlates of perception of novel objects. The neuroimaging data on participants engaged in novel object viewing versus ordinary object viewing revealed that perception of novel objects involves significant activation in the left precuneus (Brodmann area 7) and the right visual cortex. The results suggest that the left precuneus is associated with the integration of unusual features of novel objects, while the right visual cortex is sensitive to the detection of such features. Our findings highlight the left precuneus as a crucial component of the neural circuitry underlying perception of novel objects.",8,"['is known', 'was employed']",2,2,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062979,Neural Correlates of the Perception for Novel Objects

Personality traits have traditionally been viewed as stable, but recent studies suggest that they could be affected through psychological treatment. Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) for severe health anxiety (DSM-IV hypochondriasis) has been shown to be effective in reducing health anxiety, but its effect on measures of personality traits has not been investigated. The main aim of this study was to investigate the impact of ICBT on personality traits in the three broad dimensions - neuroticism, extraversion and aggression. We hypothesized that participants in ICBT would reduce their level of neuroticism compared to controls that did not receive the active treatment. No specific predictions were made regarding extraversion and aggression. Data from a randomized controlled trial were used in which participants were allocated to 12 weeks of ICBT (n = 40) or to a basic attention control condition (n = 41). Personality traits were assessed with the Swedish Universities Scales of Personality and the primary outcome of health anxiety was the Health Anxiety Inventory. There was a significant interaction effect of group and time on neuroticism-related scales, indicating larger pre- to post-treatment reductions in the Internet-based CBT group compared to the control condition. Analyses at 6-month follow-up showed that changes were stable. Traits relating to extraversion and aggression were largely unchanged. This study is the first to demonstrate that a brief ICBT intervention for severe health anxiety causes long-term changes in measures of personality traits related to neuroticism. The treatment thus has a broader impact than just reducing health anxiety.

"Abstract


Previous research has suggested that regulating emotions through reappraisal does not incur cognitive costs. However, in those experiments, cognitive costs were often assessed by recognition memory for information that was contextually related to the emotionally evocative stimuli and may have been incorporated into the reappraisal script, facilitating memory. Furthermore, there is little research on the cognitive correlates of regulating positive emotions. In the current experiment, we tested memory for information that was contextually unrelated to the emotional stimuli and could not easily be related to the reappraisal. Participants viewed neutral and mildly positive slides and either reappraised, suppressed their emotions, or viewed the images with no emotion regulation instruction. At the same time, they heard abstract words that were unrelated to the picture stimuli. Subsequent verbal recognition memory was lower after reappraising than viewing, whereas non-verbal recognition memory (of the slides) was higher after reappraising, but only for positive pictures and when participants viewed the positive pictures first. Suppression had no significant effect on either verbal or non-verbal recognition scores, although there was a trend towards poorer recognition of verbal information. The findings support the notion that reappraisal is effortful and draws on limited cognitive resources, causing decrements in performance in a concurrent memory task.",9,"['were often assessed', 'was contextually related', 'may have been incorporated', 'be related']",4,2,0.2222222222222222,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062750,Effects of Regulating Positive Emotions through Reappraisal and Suppression on Verbal and Non-Verbal Recognition Memory

Quantitative abilities have been reported in a wide range of species, including fish. Recent studies have shown that adult guppies (Poecilia reticulata) can spontaneously select the larger number of conspecifics. In particular the evidence collected in literature suggest the existence of two distinct systems of number representation: a precise system up to 4 units, and an approximate system for larger numbers. Spontaneous numerical abilities, however, seem to be limited to 4 units at birth and it is currently unclear whether or not the large number system is absent during the first days of life. In the present study, we investigated whether newborn guppies can be trained to discriminate between large quantities. Subjects were required to discriminate between groups of dots with a 0.50 ratio (e.g., 7 vs. 14) in order to obtain a food reward. To dissociate the roles of number and continuous quantities that co-vary with numerical information (such as cumulative surface area, space and density), three different experiments were set up: in Exp. 1 number and continuous quantities were simultaneously available. In Exp. 2 we controlled for continuous quantities and only numerical information was available; in Exp. 3 numerical information was made irrelevant and only continuous quantities were available. Subjects successfully solved the tasks in Exp. 1 and 2, providing the first evidence of large number discrimination in newborn fish. No discrimination was found in experiment 3, meaning that number acuity is better than spatial acuity. A comparison with the onset of numerical abilities observed in shoal-choice tests suggests that training procedures can promote the development of numerical abilities in guppies.",15,"['have been reported', 'be limited', 'can be trained', 'were required', 'were set', 'was made', 'was found']",7,7,0.4666666666666667,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062466,Large Number Discrimination in Newborn Fish
"Abstract


Regression analysis with a bounded outcome is a common problem in applied statistics. Typical examples include regression models for percentage outcomes and the analysis of ratings that are measured on a bounded scale. In this paper, we consider beta regression, which is a generalization of logit models to situations where the response is continuous on the interval (0,1). Consequently, beta regression is a convenient tool for analyzing percentage responses. The classical approach to fit a beta regression model is to use maximum likelihood estimation with subsequent AIC-based variable selection. As an alternative to this established - yet unstable - approach, we propose a new estimation technique called boosted beta regression. With boosted beta regression estimation and variable selection can be carried out simultaneously in a highly efficient way. Additionally, both the mean and the variance of a percentage response can be modeled using flexible nonlinear covariate effects. As a consequence, the new method accounts for common problems such as overdispersion and non-binomial variance structures.",9,"['are measured', 'can be carried', 'can be modeled']",3,3,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0061623,Boosted Beta Regression
"Abstract


Regular exercise training improves maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), but the optimal intensity and volume necessary to obtain maximal benefit remains to be defined. A growing body of evidence suggests that exercise training with low-volume but high-intensity may be a time-efficient means to achieve health benefits. In the present study, we measured changes in VO2max and traditional cardiovascular risk factors after a 10 wk. training protocol that involved three weekly high-intensity interval sessions. One group followed a protocol which consisted of 4×4 min at 90% of maximal heart rate (HRmax) interspersed with 3 min active recovery at 70% HRmax (4-AIT), the other group performed a single bout protocol that consisted of 1×4 min at 90% HRmax (1-AIT). Twenty-six inactive but otherwise healthy overweight men (BMI: 25–30, age: 35–45 y) were randomized to either 1-AIT (n = 11) or 4-AIT (n = 13). After training, VO2max increased by 10% (∼5.0 mL⋅kg−1⋅min−1) and 13% (∼6.5 mL⋅kg−1⋅min−1) after 1-AIT and 4-AIT, respectively (group difference, p = 0.08). Oxygen cost during running at a sub-maximal workload was reduced by 14% and 13% after 1-AIT and 4-AIT, respectively. Systolic blood pressure decreased by 7.1 and 2.6 mmHg after 1-AIT and 4-AIT respectively, while diastolic pressure decreased by 7.7 and 6.1 mmHg (group difference, p = 0.84). Both groups had a similar ∼5% decrease in fasting glucose. Body fat, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and ox-LDL cholesterol only were significantly reduced after 4-AIT. Our data suggest that a single bout of AIT performed three times per week may be a time-efficient strategy to improve VO2max and reduce blood pressure and fasting glucose in previously inactive but otherwise healthy middle-aged individuals. The 1-AIT type of exercise training may be readily implemented as part of activities of daily living and could easily be translated into programs designed to improve public health.

"Abstract


Research on treatments in anorexia nervosa (AN) is scarce. Although most of the therapeutic programs used in ‘real world practice’ in AN treatment resort to multidisciplinary approaches, they have rarely been evaluated.



Objective
To compare two multidimensional post-hospitalization outpatients treatment programs for adolescents with severe AN: Treatment as Usual (TAU) versus this treatment plus family therapy (TAU+FT).



Method
Sixty female AN adolescents, aged 13 to 19 years, were included in a randomized parallel controlled trial conducted from 1999 to 2002 for the recruitment, and until 2004 for the 18 months follow-up. Allocation to one of the two treatment groups (30 in each arm) was randomised. The TAU program included sessions for the patient alone as well as sessions with a psychiatrist for the patient and her parents. The TAU+FT program was identical to the usual one but also included family therapy sessions targeting intra-familial dynamics, but not eating disorder symptoms. The main Outcome Measure was the Morgan and Russell outcome category (Good or Intermediate versus Poor outcome). Secondary outcome indicators included AN symptoms or their consequences (eating symptoms, body mass index, amenorrhea, number of hospitalizations in the course of follow-up, social adjustment). The evaluators, but not participants, were blind to randomization.



Results
At 18 months follow-up, we found a significant group effect for the Morgan and Russell outcome category in favor of the program with family therapy (Intention-to-treat: TAU+FT :12/30 (40%); TAU : 5/29 (17.2%) p = 0.05; Per Protocol analysis: respectively 12/26 (46.2%); 4/27 (14.8%), p = 0.01). Similar group effects were observed in terms of achievement of a healthy weight (i.e., BMI≥10th percentile) and menstrual status.



Conclusions
Adding family therapy sessions, focusing on intra-familial dynamics rather than eating symptomatology, to a multidimensional program improves treatment effectiveness in girls with severe AN.

"Abstract


Retinal visual prostheses (“bionic eyes”) have the potential to restore vision to blind or profoundly vision-impaired patients. The medical bionic technology used to design, manufacture and implant such prostheses is still in its relative infancy, with various technologies and surgical approaches being evaluated. We hypothesised that a suprachoroidal implant location (between the sclera and choroid of the eye) would provide significant surgical and safety benefits for patients, allowing them to maintain preoperative residual vision as well as gaining prosthetic vision input from the device. This report details the first-in-human Phase 1 trial to investigate the use of retinal implants in the suprachoroidal space in three human subjects with end-stage retinitis pigmentosa. The success of the suprachoroidal surgical approach and its associated safety benefits, coupled with twelve-month post-operative efficacy data, holds promise for the field of vision restoration.

"Abstract


Reverse simulation models of facial expression recognition suggest that we recognize the emotions of others by running implicit motor programmes responsible for the production of that expression. Previous work has tested this theory by examining facial expression recognition in participants with Möbius sequence, a condition characterized by congenital bilateral facial paralysis. However, a mixed pattern of findings has emerged, and it has not yet been tested whether these individuals can imagine facial expressions, a process also hypothesized to be underpinned by proprioceptive feedback from the face. We investigated this issue by examining expression recognition and imagery in six participants with Möbius sequence, and also carried out tests assessing facial identity and object recognition, as well as basic visual processing. While five of the six participants presented with expression recognition impairments, only one was impaired at the imagery of facial expressions. Further, five participants presented with other difficulties in the recognition of facial identity or objects, or in lower-level visual processing. We discuss the implications of our findings for the reverse simulation model, and suggest that facial identity recognition impairments may be more severe in the condition than has previously been noted.",7,"['been tested', 'be underpinned', 'was impaired', 'been noted']",4,3,0.42857142857142855,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062656,First Report of Generalized Face Processing Difficulties in Möbius Sequence
"Abstract


Studies in rodents have demonstrated that insulin in the central nervous system induces satiety. In humans, these effects are less well established. Insulin detemir is a basal insulin analog that causes less weight gain than other basal insulin formulations, including the current standard intermediate-long acting Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin. Due to its structural modifications, which render the molecule more lipophilic, it was proposed that insulin detemir enters the brain more readily than other insulins. The aim of this study was to investigate whether insulin detemir treatment differentially modifies brain activation in response to food stimuli as compared to NPH insulin. In addition, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) insulin levels were measured after both treatments. Brain responses to viewing food and non-food pictures were measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in 32 type 1 diabetic patients, after each of two 12-week treatment periods with insulin detemir and NPH insulin, respectively, both combined with prandial insulin aspart. CSF insulin levels were determined in a subgroup. Insulin detemir decreased body weight by 0.8 kg and NPH insulin increased weight by 0.5 kg (p = 0.02 for difference), while both treatments resulted in similar glycemic control. After treatment with insulin detemir, as compared to NPH insulin, brain activation was significantly lower in bilateral insula in response to visual food stimuli, compared to NPH (p = 0.02 for right and p = 0.05 for left insula). Also, CSF insulin levels were higher compared to those with NPH insulin treatment (p = 0.003). Our findings support the hypothesis that in type 1 diabetic patients, the weight sparing effect of insulin detemir may be mediated by its enhanced action on the central nervous system, resulting in blunted activation in bilateral insula, an appetite-regulating brain region, in response to food stimuli.

"Abstract


Telomere length is considered to be a risk factor in adults due to its proved association with cancer incidence and mortality. Since newborn present a wide interindividual variation in mean telomere length, it is relevant to demonstrate if these differences in length can act also as an early risk indicator. To answer this question, we have measured the mean telomere length of 74 samples of cord blood from newborns and studied its association with the basal genetic damage, measured as the frequency of binucleated cells carrying micronuclei. In addition, we have challenged the cells of a subgroup of individuals (N = 35) against mitomycin-C (MMC) to establish their sensitivity to induced genomic instability. Results indicate that newborn with shorter telomeres present significantly higher levels of genetic damage when compared to those with longer telomeres. In addition, the cellular response to MMC was also significantly higher among those samples from subjects with shorter telomeres. Independently of the causal mechanisms involved, our results show for the first time that telomere length at delivery influence both the basal and induced genetic damage of the individual.

"Abstract


The aim of this study was to determine the reliability of the conditioned pain modulation (CPM) paradigm assessed by an objective electrophysiological method, the nociceptive withdrawal reflex (NWR), and psychophysical measures, using hypothetical sample sizes for future studies as analytical goals. Thirty-four healthy volunteers participated in two identical experimental sessions, separated by 1 to 3 weeks. In each session, the cold pressor test (CPT) was used to induce CPM, and the NWR thresholds, electrical pain detection thresholds and pain intensity ratings after suprathreshold electrical stimulation were assessed before and during CPT. CPM was consistently detected by all methods, and the electrophysiological measures did not introduce additional variation to the assessment. In particular, 99% of the trials resulted in higher NWR thresholds during CPT, with an average increase of 3.4 mA (p<0.001). Similarly, 96% of the trials resulted in higher electrical pain detection thresholds during CPT, with an average increase of 2.2 mA (p<0.001). Pain intensity ratings after suprathreshold electrical stimulation were reduced during CPT in 84% of the trials, displaying an average decrease of 1.5 points in a numeric rating scale (p<0.001). Under these experimental conditions, CPM reliability was acceptable for all assessment methods in terms of sample sizes for potential experiments. The presented results are encouraging with regards to the use of the CPM as an assessment tool in experimental and clinical pain.

"Abstract


The aim of this systematic review is to describe participation in social and physical leisure activities among children and adolescents with JIA, as well as identify potential determinants of leisure participation.



Methods
Electronic databases were systematically searched for articles published up until June 2013 pertaining to participation in leisure activities among youth with JIA and other rheumatic diseases. Studies were included if they measured involvement in either social or physical leisure activities. Selection and quality appraisal of articles were completed independently by two authors.



Results
Eight hundred and ninety-three articles were found through electronic and reference search. One hundred and nine full articles were reviewed to assess for eligibility. Twelve articles met inclusion criteria and findings were reviewed. Most focused on describing participation in physical rather than social activities. Results suggest that youth with JIA participated less in both social and physical leisure activities as compared to healthy peers, and those with JIA did not meet national recommendations for physical activity. Potential determinants of leisure participation were socio-demographic (age, sex), anthropometric (height, weight) and disease-related (JIA subtype, disease duration, pain, number of swollen or painful joints, stiffness, fatigue, well-being) factors.



Conclusion
Characterization of leisure activity remains limited and mostly focused on physical activity in JIA. Assessment of more comprehensive outcome measures is warranted to obtain a better description of leisure in this population. Evidence of the influence of contextual factors as potential determinants of involvement in leisure among children with pediatric rheumatologic diseases is needed.",13,"['were systematically searched', 'were included', 'were completed', 'were found', 'were reviewed', 'were reviewed', 'is warranted', 'is needed']",8,8,0.6153846153846154,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0104642,Leisure in Children and Adolescents with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: A Systematic Review

The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effect of Contrast Water Therapy (CWT) on recovery following exercise induced muscle damage. Controlled trials were identified from computerized literature searching and citation tracking performed up to February 2013. Eighteen trials met the inclusion criteria; all had a high risk of bias. Pooled data from 13 studies showed that CWT resulted in significantly greater improvements in muscle soreness at the five follow-up time points (<6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours) in comparison to passive recovery. Pooled data also showed that CWT significantly reduced muscle strength loss at each follow-up time (<6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours) in comparison to passive recovery. Despite comparing CWT to a large number of other recovery interventions, including cold water immersion, warm water immersion, compression, active recovery and stretching, there was little evidence for a superior treatment intervention. The current evidence base shows that CWT is superior to using passive recovery or rest after exercise; the magnitudes of these effects may be most relevant to an elite sporting population. There seems to be little difference in recovery outcome between CWT and other popular recovery interventions.",8,['were identified'],1,1,0.125,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062356,Contrast Water Therapy and Exercise Induced Muscle Damage: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
"Abstract


The brain is able to maintain a stable perception although the visual stimuli vary substantially on the retina due to geometric transformations and lighting variations in the environment. This paper presents a theory for achieving basic invariance properties already at the level of receptive fields. Specifically, the presented framework comprises (i) local scaling transformations caused by objects of different size and at different distances to the observer, (ii) locally linearized image deformations caused by variations in the viewing direction in relation to the object, (iii) locally linearized relative motions between the object and the observer and (iv) local multiplicative intensity transformations caused by illumination variations. The receptive field model can be derived by necessity from symmetry properties of the environment and leads to predictions about receptive field profiles in good agreement with receptive field profiles measured by cell recordings in mammalian vision. Indeed, the receptive field profiles in the retina, LGN and V1 are close to ideal to what is motivated by the idealized requirements. By complementing receptive field measurements with selection mechanisms over the parameters in the receptive field families, it is shown how true invariance of receptive field responses can be obtained under scaling transformations, affine transformations and Galilean transformations. Thereby, the framework provides a mathematically well-founded and biologically plausible model for how basic invariance properties can be achieved already at the level of receptive fields and support invariant recognition of objects and events under variations in viewpoint, retinal size, object motion and illumination. The theory can explain the different shapes of receptive field profiles found in biological vision, which are tuned to different sizes and orientations in the image domain as well as to different image velocities in space-time, from a requirement that the visual system should be invariant to the natural types of image transformations that occur in its environment.",8,"['transformations caused', 'deformations caused', 'can be derived', 'is motivated', 'is shown', 'can be obtained', 'can be achieved', 'are tuned']",8,6,0.75,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066990,Invariance of visual operations at the level of receptive fields
"Abstract


The marked anatomical and functional changes taking place in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) during adolescence set grounds for the high incidence of neuropsychiatric disorders with adolescent onset. Although circuit refinement through synapse pruning may constitute the anatomical basis for the cognitive differences reported between adolescents and adults, a physiological correlate of circuit refinement at the level of neuronal ensembles has not been demonstrated. We have recorded neuronal activity together with local field potentials in the medial PFC of juvenile and adult mice under anesthesia, which allowed studying local functional connectivity without behavioral or sensorial interference. Entrainment of pyramidal neurons and interneurons to gamma oscillations, but not to theta or beta oscillations, was reduced after adolescence. Interneurons were synchronized to gamma oscillations across a wider area of the PFC than pyramidal neurons, and the span of interneuron synchronization was shorter in adults than juvenile mice. Thus, transition from childhood to adulthood is characterized by reduction of the strength and span of neuronal synchronization specific to gamma oscillations in the mPFC. The more restricted and weak ongoing synchronization in adults may allow a more dynamic rearrangement of neuronal ensembles during behavior and promote parallel processing of information.",7,"['been demonstrated', 'was reduced', 'were synchronized', 'is characterized']",4,4,0.5714285714285714,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062978,Refinement of Neuronal Synchronization with Gamma Oscillations in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex after Adolescence

The present study aimed at investigating the effect of MDMA on measures of empathy and social interaction, and the roles of oxytocin and the 5-HT1A receptor in these effects. The design was placebo-controlled within-subject with 4 treatment conditions: MDMA (75 mg), with or without pindolol (20 mg), oxytocin nasal spray (40 IU+16 IU) or placebo. Participants were 20 healthy poly-drug MDMA users, aged between 18–26 years. Cognitive and emotional empathy were assessed by means of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and the Multifaceted Empathy Test. Social interaction, defined as trust and reciprocity, was assessed by means of a Trust Game and a Social Ball Tossing Game. Results showed that MDMA selectively affected emotional empathy and left cognitive empathy, trust and reciprocity unaffected. When combined with pindolol, these effects remained unchanged. Oxytocin did not affect measures of empathy and social interaction. Changes in emotional empathy were not related to oxytocin plasma levels. It was concluded that MDMA (75 mg) selectively enhances emotional empathy in humans. While the underlying neurobiological mechanism is still unknown, it is suggested that peripheral oxytocin does not seem to be the main actor in this; potential candidates are the serotonin 2A and the vasopressin 1A receptors.

The present study investigated the antifatigue effects of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer in 90 subjects (21 men and 69 women) with idiopathic chronic fatigue (ICF) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and parallel designed trial. A bespoke 20% ethanol extract of P. ginseng (1 g or 2 g day–1) or a placebo was administered to each group for 4 weeks, and then fatigue severity was monitored using a self-rating numeric scale (NRS) and a visual analogue scale (VAS) as a primary endpoint. Serum levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), total glutathione (GSH) contents and glutathione reductase (GSH-Rd) activity were determined. After 4-week, P. ginseng administration decreased the total NRS score, but they were not statistically significant compared with placebo (P>0.05). Mental NRS score was significantly improved by P. ginseng administrations as 20.4±5.0 to 15.1±6.5 [95% CI 2.3∼8.2] for 1 g and 20.7±6.3 to 13.8±6.2 [95% CI −0.1∼4.2] for 2 g compared with placebo 20.9±4.5 to 18.8±2.9 [95% CI 4.1∼9.9, P<0.01]. Only 2 g P. ginseng significantly reduced the VAS score from 7.3±1.3 to 4.4±1.8 [95% CI 0.7∼1.8] compared with the placebo 7.1±1.0 to 5.8±1.3 [95% CI 2.2 ∼3.7, P<0.01]. ROS and MDA levels were lowered by P. ginseng compared to placebo. P. ginseng 1 g increased GSH concentration and GSH-Rd activity. Our results provide the first evidence of the antifatigue effects of P. ginseng in patients with ICF, and we submit that these changes in antioxidant properties contribute in part to its mechanism.

The syndrome of high-altitude de-acclimatization commonly takes place after long-term exposure to high altitudes upon return to low altitudes. The syndrome severely affects the returnee's quality of life. However, little attention has been paid to careful characterization of the syndrome and their underlying mechanisms. Male subjects from Chongqing (n = 67, 180 m) and Kunming (n = 70, 1800 m) visited a high-altitude area (3650 m) about 6 months and then returned to low-altitude. After they came back, all subjects were evaluated for high-altitude de-acclimatization syndrome on the 3rd, 50th, and 100th. Symptom scores, routine blood and blood gas tests, and myocardial zymograms assay were used for observation their syndrome. The results showed that the incidence and severity of symptoms had decreased markedly on the 50th and 100th days, compared with the 3rd day. The symptom scores and incidence of different symptoms were lower among subjects returning to Kunming than among those returning to Chongqing. On the 3rd day, RBC, Hb, Hct, CK, CK-MB, and LDH values were significantly lower than values recorded at high altitudes, but they were higher than baseline values. On the 50th day, these values were not different from baseline values, but LDH levels did not return to baseline until the 100th day. These data show that, subjects who suffered high-altitude de-acclimatization syndrome, the recovery fully processes takes a long time (≥100th days). The appearance of the syndrome is found to be related to the changes in RBC, Hb, Hct, CK, CK-MB, and LDH levels, which should be caused by reoxygenation after hypoxia.",11,"['has been paid', 'were evaluated', 'were used', 'is found', 'be related', 'should be caused']",6,3,0.2727272727272727,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062072,Analysis of High-Altitude De-Acclimatization Syndrome after Exposure to High Altitudes: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial
"Abstract


This pilot study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of an assessor-blind, randomised controlled trial of psychodynamic art therapy for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia, and to generate preliminary data on the efficacy of this intervention during acute psychotic episodes. Fifty-eight inpatients with DSM-diagnoses of schizophrenia were randomised to either 12 twice-weekly sessions of psychodynamic group art therapy plus treatment as usual or to standard treatment alone. Primary outcome criteria were positive and negative psychotic and depressive symptoms as well as global assessment of functioning. Secondary outcomes were mentalising function, estimated with the Reading the mind in the eyes test and the Levels of emotional awareness scale, self-efficacy, locus of control, quality of life and satisfaction with care. Assessments were made at baseline, at post-treatment and at 12 weeks' follow-up. At 12 weeks, 55% of patients randomised to art therapy, and 66% of patients receiving treatment as usual were examined. In the per-protocol sample, art therapy was associated with a significantly greater mean reduction of positive symptoms and improved psychosocial functioning at post-treatment and follow-up, and with a greater mean reduction of negative symptoms at follow-up compared to standard treatment. The significant reduction of positive symptoms at post-treatment was maintained in an attempted intention-to-treat analysis. There were no group differences regarding depressive symptoms. Of secondary outcome parameters, patients in the art therapy group showed a significant improvement in levels of emotional awareness, and particularly in their ability to reflect about others' emotional mental states. This is one of the first randomised controlled trials on psychodynamic group art therapy for patients with acute psychotic episodes receiving hospital treatment. Results prove the feasibility of trials on art therapy during acute psychotic episodes and justify further research to substantiate preliminary positive results regarding symptom reduction and the recovery of mentalising function.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an enormous public health problem, with 1.7 million new cases of TBI recorded annually by the Centers for Disease Control. However, TBI has proven to be an extremely challenging condition to treat. Here, we apply a nanoprodrug strategy in a mouse model of TBI. The novel nanoprodrug contains a derivative of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen in an emulsion with the antioxidant α-tocopherol. The ibuprofen derivative, Ibu2TEG, contains a tetra ethylene glycol (TEG) spacer consisting of biodegradable ester bonds. The biodegradable ester bonds ensure that the prodrug molecules break down hydrolytically or enzymatically. The drug is labeled with the fluorescent reporter Cy5.5 using nonbiodegradable bonds to 1-octadecanethiol, allowing us to reliably track its accumulation in the brain after TBI. We delivered a moderate injury using a highly reproducible mouse model of closed-skull controlled cortical impact to the parietal region of the cortex, followed by an injection of the nanoprodrug at a dose of 0.2 mg per mouse. The blood brain barrier is known to exhibit increased permeability at the site of injury. We tested for accumulation of the fluorescent drug particles at the site of injury using confocal and bioluminescence imaging of whole brains and brain slices 36 hours after administration. We demonstrated that the drug does accumulate preferentially in the region of injured tissue, likely due to an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) phenomenon. The use of a nanoprodrug approach to deliver therapeutics in TBI represents a promising potential therapeutic modality.",12,"['is labeled', 'followed by an injection of the nanoprodrug at a dose of 0.2 mg per mouse', 'is known']",3,3,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0061819,Reactive Oxygen Species-Activated Nanoprodrug of Ibuprofen for Targeting Traumatic Brain Injury in Mice

Voice, as a secondary sexual characteristic, is known to affect the perceived attractiveness of human individuals. But the underlying mechanism of vocal attractiveness has remained unclear. Here, we presented human listeners with acoustically altered natural sentences and fully synthetic sentences with systematically manipulated pitch, formants and voice quality based on a principle of body size projection reported for animal calls and emotional human vocal expressions. The results show that male listeners preferred a female voice that signals a small body size, with relatively high pitch, wide formant dispersion and breathy voice, while female listeners preferred a male voice that signals a large body size with low pitch and narrow formant dispersion. Interestingly, however, male vocal attractiveness was also enhanced by breathiness, which presumably softened the aggressiveness associated with a large body size. These results, together with the additional finding that the same vocal dimensions also affect emotion judgment, indicate that humans still employ a vocal interaction strategy used in animal calls despite the development of complex language.",6,"['is known', 'was also enhanced']",2,2,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062397,Human Vocal Attractiveness as Signaled by Body Size Projection
"Abstract


Within the animal kingdom, human cooperation represents an outlier. As such, there has been great interest across a number of fields in identifying the factors that support the complex and flexible variety of cooperation that is uniquely human. The ability to identify and preferentially interact with better social partners (partner choice) is proposed to be a major factor in maintaining costly cooperation between individuals. Here we show that the ability to engage in flexible and effective partner choice behavior can be traced back to early childhood. Specifically, across two studies, we demonstrate that by 3 years of age, children identify effective communication as “helpful” (Experiments 1 & 2), reward good communicators with information (Experiment 1), and selectively reciprocate communication with diverse cooperative acts (Experiment 2). Taken together, these results suggest that even in early childhood, humans take advantage of cooperative benefits, while mitigating free-rider risks, through appropriate partner choice behavior.",6,"['is proposed', 'can be traced']",2,2,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0061804,Children’s Use of Communicative Intent in the Selection of Cooperative Partners

β-turns are the most common type of non-repetitive structures, and constitute on average 25% of the amino acids in proteins. The formation of β-turns plays an important role in protein folding, protein stability and molecular recognition processes. In this work we present the neural network method NetTurnP, for prediction of two-class β-turns and prediction of the individual β-turn types, by use of evolutionary information and predicted protein sequence features. It has been evaluated against a commonly used dataset BT426, and achieves a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.50, which is the highest reported performance on a two-class prediction of β-turn and not-β-turn. Furthermore NetTurnP shows improved performance on some of the specific β-turn types. In the present work, neural network methods have been trained to predict β-turn or not and individual β-turn types from the primary amino acid sequence. The individual β-turn types I, I', II, II', VIII, VIa1, VIa2, VIba and IV have been predicted based on classifications by PROMOTIF, and the two-class prediction of β-turn or not is a superset comprised of all β-turn types. The performance is evaluated using a golden set of non-homologous sequences known as BT426. Our two-class prediction method achieves a performance of: MCC  = 0.50, Qtotal = 82.1%, sensitivity  = 75.6%, PPV  = 68.8% and AUC  = 0.864. We have compared our performance to eleven other prediction methods that obtain Matthews correlation coefficients in the range of 0.17 – 0.47. For the type specific β-turn predictions, only type I and II can be predicted with reasonable Matthews correlation coefficients, where we obtain performance values of 0.36 and 0.31, respectively.



Conclusion
The NetTurnP method has been implemented as a webserver, which is freely available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetTurnP/.

"Abstract

(a) Objective
This study aimed to identify trajectories of alcohol use (AU) and their associations with the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) among young men with different weekly drinking patterns.



(b) Method
A longitudinal latent class analysis integrating several aspects of AU, such as drinking quantity and frequency on weekends vs workweek days, involving 4719 young Swiss men at ages 20, 21, and 25, and collected by the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors, was used to identify different AU trajectories over time. The development of AUD scores in these trajectories was investigated using generalized linear mixed models.



(c) Results
Six AU trajectory classes, similar to those described in the literature, were identified: ‘abstainers–light drinkers’, ‘light workweek increasers’, ‘light decreasers’, ‘moderate weekend decreasers’, ‘moderate workweek increasers’, and ‘heavy drinkers’. Only 12% of participants were assigned to a trajectory class with decreasing AU associated with a decline in their AUD score. AUD scores increased in trajectory classes exhibiting increasing AU on workweek days, despite low and moderate general AU. Finally, more than 59% of participants were on an AU trajectory presenting no change in their mean AUD score over time.



(d) Conclusions
Maturing out of problematic AU in emerging adulthood is not the norm in Switzerland, and the AUD score developed in late adolescence remains until at least emerging adulthood. AU on workweek days is a more practical marker of potentially problematic AU. This calls for timely interventions in adolescence and concerning regular drinking on workweek days in emerging adulthood.",11,"['was used', 'was investigated', 'were identified', 'were assigned']",4,4,0.36363636363636365,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0220232,Multiple trajectories of alcohol use and the development of alcohol use disorder: Do Swiss men mature-out of problematic alcohol use during emerging adulthood?

Abstract
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is an independent risk factor for sleep breathing disorders. However, it is unknown whether T2D affects daily somnolence and quality of sleep independently of the impairment of polysomnographic parameters.



Material and Methods
A case-control study including 413 patients with T2D and 413 non-diabetic subjects, matched by age, gender, BMI, and waist and neck circumferences. A polysomnography was performed and daytime sleepiness was evaluated using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). In addition, 135 subjects with T2D and 45 controls matched by the same previous parameters were also evaluated through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to calculate sleep quality.



Results
Daytime sleepiness was higher in T2D than in control subjects (p = 0.003), with 23.9% of subjects presenting an excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS>10). Patients with fasting plasma glucose (FPG ≥13.1 mmol/l) were identified as the group with a higher risk associated with an ESS>10 (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.8–7.9, p = 0.0003). A stepwise regression analyses showed that the presence of T2D, baseline glucose levels and gender but not polysomnographic parameters (i.e apnea-hyoapnea index or sleeping time spent with oxigen saturation lower than 90%) independently predicted the ESS score. In addition, subjects with T2D showed higher sleep disturbances [PSQI: 7.0 (1.0–18.0) vs. 4 (0.0–12.0), p<0.001].



Conclusion
The presence of T2D and high levels of FPG are independent risk factors for daytime sleepiness and adversely affect sleep quality. Prospective studies addressed to demonstrate whether glycemia optimization could improve the sleep quality in T2D patients seem warranted.",11,"['was performed', 'was evaluated', 'were also evaluated', 'were identified']",4,3,0.2727272727272727,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157579,Global Assessment of the Impact of Type 2 Diabetes on Sleep through Specific Questionnaires.

"Abstract

Aim
A formal Needle and Syringe Program (NSP) is not provided in Australian prisons. Injecting equipment circulates in prisons as part of an informal and illegal economy. This paper examined how this economy generates blood-borne virus (BBV) risk and risk mitigation opportunities for inmates.



Method
The HITS-p cohort recruited New South Wales inmates who had reported ever injecting drugs and who had a negative HCV serological test within 12 months prior to enrolment. For this study, qualitative interviews were conducted with 30 participants enrolled in HITS-p. Participants included 10 women and were incarcerated in 12 prisons.



Results
A needle/syringe was nominated as being typically priced in the ‘inside’ prison economy at $100-$150, with a range of $50-$350. Purchase or hire of equipment was paid for in cash (including transactions that occurred outside prison) and in exchange for drugs and other commodities. A range of other resources was required to enable successful needle/syringe economies, especially relationships with visitors and other prisoners, and violence to ensure payment of debts. Strategies to mitigate BBV risk included retaining one needle/syringe for personal use while hiring out others, keeping drug use (and ownership of equipment) “quiet”, stealing used equipment from the prison health clinic, and manufacture of syringes from other items available in the prison.



Conclusions
The provision of prison NSP would disrupt the inside economies built around contraband needles/syringes, as well as minimise BBV risk. However, any model of prison NSP should be interrogated for any unanticipated markets that could be generated as a result of its regulatory practices.",10,"['is not provided', 'were conducted', 'were incarcerated', 'was nominated', 'being typically priced', 'was paid', 'was required', 'should be interrogated', 'could be generated']",9,6,0.6,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162399,The Prison Economy of Needles and Syringes: What Opportunities Exist for Blood Borne Virus Risk Reduction When Prices Are so High?

Aim
Accumulating evidence suggests that extracellular galectin-1 and galectin-3 promote angiogenesis. Increased expression of galectin-1 and/or galectin-3 has been reported to be associated with tumour progression. Thus, it is critical to identify their influence on angiogenesis.



Methods
We examined the individual and combined effects of galectin-1 and galectin-3 on endothelial cell (EC) growth and tube formation using two EC lines, EA.hy926 and HUVEC. The activation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) was determined by ELISA and Western blots. We evaluated the VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 levels in endosomes by proximity ligation assay.



Results
We observed different responses to exogenous galectins depending on the EC line. An enhanced effect on EA.hy926 cell growth and tube formation was observed when both galectins were added together. Focusing on this enhanced effect, we observed that together galectins induced the phosphorylation of both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, whereas galectin-1 and −3 alone induced VEGFR2 phosphorylation only. In the same way, the addition of a blocking VEGFR1 antibody completely abolished the increase in tube formation induced by the combined addition of both galectins. In contrast, the addition of a blocking VEGFR2 antibody only partially inhibited this effect. Finally, the addition of both galectins induced a decrease in the VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 endocytic pools, with a significantly enhanced effect on the VEGFR1 endocytic pool. These results suggest that the combined action of galectin-1 and galectin-3 has an enhanced effect on angiogenesis via VEGFR1 activation, which could be related to a decrease in receptor endocytosis.",13,"['has been reported', 'was determined', 'was observed', 'were added', 'could be related']",5,4,0.3076923076923077,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0067029,VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 Involvement in Extracellular Galectin-1- and Galectin-3-Induced Angiogenesis
"Abstract

Aim
Alcohol related disease conditions are responsible for a significant proportion of morbidity and mortality in Sri Lanka. This study quantified the economic cost of selected alcohol related disease conditions in Sri Lanka in 2015.



Methods
This study uses the prevalence-based cost of illness methodology specified by the World Health Organization, and uses the gross costing approach. The direct costs includes the costs of curative care (inpatient and outpatient care borne by the state and out of pocket expenditure borne by patients) for alcohol related diseases, weighted by the respective population attributable fractions. Indirect costs consist of lost earnings due to absenteeism of the patient and carers due to seeking care and recuperation, and the loss of income due to mortality.
Data form the Ministry of Health, Registrar General’s Department, Department of Census and Statistics and the National Cancer Registry was used. Systemic and house costs and population attributable fractions were obtained from research studies. Economists, Public Health Experts, Medical Administrators and Clinical Specialists were iteratively consulted during the estimation and validation of the costs and the results.



Results
The estimated present value of current and future economic cost of the alcohol-related conditions for Sri Lanka in 2015 was USD 885.86 million, 1.07% of the GDP of that year. The direct cost of alcohol related disease conditions was USD 388.35 million, which was 44% of the total cost, while the indirect cost was USD 497.50 million, which was 66% of the total cost. Road Injury cost was the highest cost category among the conditions studied.



Conclusion
Addressing alcohol use and its harms through effective implementation of evidence-based polices and interventions is urgently required to address the economic costs of alcohol use in Sri Lanka as it imposes a significant burden to the country.",12,"['borne by', 'borne by', 'was used', 'were obtained', 'were iteratively consulted', 'is urgently required']",6,5,0.4166666666666667,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198640,Economic costs of alcohol use in Sri Lanka

Aim
Although evidence supports brief, frequent CPR training, optimal training intervals have not been established. The purpose of this study was to compare nursing students’ CPR skills (compressions and ventilations) with 4 different spaced training intervals: daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly, each for 4 times in a row.



Methods
Participants were nursing students (n = 475) in the first year of their prelicensure program in 10 schools of nursing across the United States. They were randomly assigned into the 4 training intervals in each of the schools. Students were trained in CPR on a Laerdal Resusci Anne adult manikin on the Resuscitation Quality Improvement (RQI) mobile simulation station. The outcome measures were quality of compressions and ventilations as measured by the RQI program.



Results
Although students were all certified in Basic Life Support prior to the study, they were not able to adequately perform compressions and ventilations at pretest. Overall compression scores improved from sessions 1 to 4 in all training intervals (all p < .001), but shorter intervals (daily training) resulted in larger increases in compression scores by session 4. There were similar findings for ventilation skills, but at session 4, both daily and weekly intervals led to better skill performance.



Conclusion
For students and other novices learning to perform CPR, the opportunity to train on consecutive days or weeks may be beneficial: if learners are aware of specific errors in performance, it may be easier for them to correct performance and refine skills when there is less time in between practice sessions.",10,"['been established', 'were randomly assigned', 'were trained', 'measured by the rqi program', 'were all certified']",5,5,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0226786,Training interval in cardiopulmonary resuscitation

Aim
Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a common mental health condition with high patterns of service utilisation of inpatient and community treatment. Over the past five years there has been significant growth in research with economic data, making this systematic review a timely update.



Methods
Empirical studies written in English or German, published up to December 2015, and cited in major electronic databases were examined using the PRISMA systematic review method. Papers were included that had one of the following: data related to cost of BPD to society, the individual, the carer or families; cost benefits of interventions. Reported cost data were inflated to the year 2015 and converted into US- dollars (USD $) using purchasing power parities.



Results
We identified 30 economic evaluations providing cost data related to interventions for BPD across 134,136 patients. The methodological quality was good, almost all studies fulfilled ≥ 50% of the quality criteria. The mean cost saving for treating BPD with evidence-based psychotherapy across studies was USD $2,987.82 per patient per year. A further mean weighted reduction of USD $1,551 per patient per year (range $83 - $29,392) was found compared to treatment as usual. Evidence-based psychological treatment was both less expensive as well as more effective, despite considerable differences in health cost arrangements between individual studies and countries. Where it was able to be calculated, a significant difference in cost-savings between different types of evidence-based psychotherapies was found.



Discussion
Individuals with BPD consistently demonstrate high patterns of service utilization and therefore high costs. The findings of this review present a strong argument in favour of prioritizing BPD treatments in reimbursement decisions, both for the affected individual and the family. The provision of evidence based treatment, irrespective of the type of psychological treatment, may lead to widespread reductions in healthcare costs.",14,"['studies written', 'were examined', 'were included', 'data related', 'were inflated', 'was found', 'be calculated', 'was found']",8,5,0.35714285714285715,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171592,The value of psychological treatment for borderline personality disorder: Systematic review and cost offset analysis of economic evaluations

Aim
Children and adolescents with low socioeconomic status (SES) suffer from mental health problems more often than their peers with high SES. The aim of the current study was to investigate the direct and interactive association between commonly used indicators of SES and the exposure to stressful life situations in relation to children’s mental health problems.



Methods
The prospective BELLA cohort study is the mental health module of the representative, population-based German National Health Interview and Examination Survey for children and adolescents (KiGGS). Sample data include 2,111 participants (aged 7–17 years at baseline) from the first three measurement points (2003–2006, 2004–2007 and 2005–2008). Hierarchical multiple linear regression models were conducted to analyze associations among the SES indicators household income, parental education and parental unemployment (assessed at baseline), number of stressful life situations (e.g., parental accident, mental illness or severe financial crises; 1- and 2-year follow-ups) and parent-reported mental health problems (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire; 2-year follow-up).



Results
All indicators of SES separately predicted mental health problems in children and adolescents at the 2-year follow-up. Stressful life situations (between baseline and 2-year follow-up) and the interaction of parental education and the number of stressful life situations remained significant in predicting children’s mental health problems after adjustment for control variables. Thereby, children with higher educated parents showed fewer mental health problems in a stressful life situation. No moderating effect was found for household income and parental employment. Overall, the detected effect sizes were small. Mental health problems at baseline were the best predictor for mental health problems two years later.



Conclusions
Children and adolescents with a low SES suffer from multiple stressful life situations and are exposed to a higher risk of developing mental health problems. The findings suggest that the reduction of socioeconomic inequalities and interventions for families with low parental education might help to reduce children’s mental health problems.",14,"['were conducted', 'was found', 'are exposed']",3,3,0.21428571428571427,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0213700,"Socioeconomic status, stressful life situations and mental health problems in children and adolescents: Results of the German BELLA cohort-study"

Aim
Christchurch, New Zealand, experienced two major earthquakes on 4th September 2010 and 22nd February 2011. Previous studies have demonstrated that earthquakes are associated with sudden cardiac deaths. Whilst myocardial ischemia would contribute to this, ventricular arrhythmia triggered by stress has also been suggested. We aim to study the impact of the two earthquakes on ventricular arrhythmia events.



Methods
We conducted a retrospective review of all patients resident in the earthquake zone with implantable defibrillators. Ventricular arrhythmia requiring therapy and non-sustained events were recorded from the period of 30 days before thru 30 days after the two earthquakes. Weekly event rates were calculated and compared using log rank analysis. Results are expressed as mean (range), significance was determined at the <0.05 level.



Results
For the 211 patients who were exposed to the 2010 earthquake, there was no difference in the proportion of patients free of therapy, either Shock or ATP (0.943 before and 0.933 after the earthquake, p = 0.85, ns). Similarly, there was no significant increase in events requiring therapy in the 236 patients exposed to the 2011 earthquake (0.957 before and 0.961 after the earthquake, p = 0.80, ns). We identified one patient who required multiple therapy for ventricular tachycardia immediately following both earthquakes.



Conclusion
The two Christchurch earthquakes were not associated with an increase in the event rate of either sustained or non-sustained ventricular arrhythmias in our patients. We identified only a single patient who had arrhythmic storms immediately following the earthquakes.",13,"['arrhythmia triggered', 'been suggested', 'were recorded', 'were calculated and compared using', 'are expressed', 'was determined', 'were exposed']",7,5,0.38461538461538464,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0216521,Two major earthquakes in Christchurch were not associated with increased ventricular arrhythmias: Analysis of implanted defibrillator diagnostics

Aim
Crowdsourcing is the process of outsourcing numerous tasks to many untrained individuals. Our aim was to assess the performance and repeatability of crowdsourcing for the classification of retinal fundus photography.



Methods
One hundred retinal fundus photograph images with pre-determined disease criteria were selected by experts from a large cohort study. After reading brief instructions and an example classification, we requested that knowledge workers (KWs) from a crowdsourcing platform classified each image as normal or abnormal with grades of severity. Each image was classified 20 times by different KWs. Four study designs were examined to assess the effect of varying incentive and KW experience in classification accuracy. All study designs were conducted twice to examine repeatability. Performance was assessed by comparing the sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).



Results
Without restriction on eligible participants, two thousand classifications of 100 images were received in under 24 hours at minimal cost. In trial 1 all study designs had an AUC (95%CI) of 0.701(0.680–0.721) or greater for classification of normal/abnormal. In trial 1, the highest AUC (95%CI) for normal/abnormal classification was 0.757 (0.738–0.776) for KWs with moderate experience. Comparable results were observed in trial 2. In trial 1, between 64–86% of any abnormal image was correctly classified by over half of all KWs. In trial 2, this ranged between 74–97%. Sensitivity was ≥96% for normal versus severely abnormal detections across all trials. Sensitivity for normal versus mildly abnormal varied between 61–79% across trials.



Conclusions
With minimal training, crowdsourcing represents an accurate, rapid and cost-effective method of retinal image analysis which demonstrates good repeatability. Larger studies with more comprehensive participant training are needed to explore the utility of this compelling technique in large scale medical image analysis.",17,"['were selected', 'was classified', 'were examined', 'were conducted', 'was assessed', 'were received', 'were observed', 'classified by over half of all kws', 'are needed']",9,8,0.47058823529411764,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0071154,Crowdsourcing as a Novel Technique for Retinal Fundus Photography Classification: Analysis of Images in the EPIC Norfolk Cohort on Behalf of the UKBiobank Eye and Vision Consortium

Aim
Despite effective treatment for recent hepatitis C (HCV) infection, side-effects and adherence concerns limit its use among people who inject drugs (PWID). This study evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and social functioning following infection and during recent HCV treatment.



Methods
The Australian Trial of Acute Hepatitis C studied the natural history and treatment of recent HCV infection. HRQoL (SF-12v2) and social functioning (Opiate Treatment Index score) were measured over 48 weeks and their impact on treatment uptake, adherence and virological response were assessed.



Results
Of 163 participants, 111 received treatment (HCV n = 74, SVR 55%; HCV/HIV n = 37, SVR 74%). 116 (71%) were male, 124 (76%) ever injected drugs, with 55 (36%) injecting recently and 28/55 (51%) reported needle/syringe sharing. At baseline, median physical and mental HRQoL was 54 units (IQR 46–58) and 46 (35–54) (reference median: 50), respectively, and median social functioning score was 11 units (7–17). Higher social function (<10 vs ≥15) predicted increased treatment uptake (AOR 3.43, 95%CI 1.01–11.6, p = 0.048) and higher SVR (AOR 5.11, 95%CI 1.30–20.15, p = 0.020). After adjustment, treated participants had lower physical (-4.90 units, 95%CI -6.33 to -3.48, p<0.001) and mental HRQoL (-3.7 units, 95%CI -5.55 to -1.86, p<0.001) at on-treatment visits, but HRQoL returned to baseline levels during follow-up.



Conclusions
Social functioning can predict recent HCV treatment uptake and SVR. Efforts to maximise social stability may improve treatment response. Pegylated-interferon treatment is associated with reduced HRQoL on-treatment in an already vulnerable population of PWID that would be better served by interferon-free regimens particularly in treated target at PWID to prevent transmission.

Aim
Education is one of the strongest social determinants of health, yet previous literature has focused on primary education. We examined whether there are additional benefits to completing upper secondary compared to lower secondary education in a middle-income country.



Methods
We performed a longitudinal analysis of the Cape Area Panel Study, a survey of adolescents living in South Africa. We undertook causal modeling using structural marginal models to examine the association between level of education and various health outcomes, using inverse probability weighting to control for sex, age, ethnicity, home language, income, whether employed in past year, region of birth, maternal educational status, marital status, whether currently pregnant and cognitive ability. Educational attainment was defined as primary (grades 1–7), lower secondary (grades 8–9) or upper secondary (grades 10–12).



Results
Of 3,432 participants, 165 (4.8%) had completed primary education, 646 (18.8%) lower secondary and 2,621 (76.3%) upper secondary. Compared to those completing lower secondary, males completing upper secondary education were less likely to have a health problem (OR 0.49; 95%CI 0.27–0.88; p = 0.02); describe their health as poor (0.52; 0.29–0.95; p = 0.03) or report that health interferes with daily life (0.54; 0.29–0.99; p = 0.047). Females were less likely to have been pregnant (0.45; 0.33–0.61; p<0.001) or pregnant under 18 (0.32; 0.22–0.46; p<0.001); and having had sex under 16 was also less likely (males 0.63; 0.44–0.91; p = 0.01; females 0.39; 0.26–0.58; p<0.001). Cigarette smoking was less likely (males 0.52; 0.38–0.70; p = <0.001; females 0.56; 0.41–0.76; p<0.001), as was taking illicit drugs in males (0.6; 0.38–0.96; p = 0.03). No associations were found between education and alcohol use, psychological distress, obesity, increased waist circumference or hypertension.



Conclusion
Completing upper secondary education was associated with improved health outcomes compared with lower secondary education. Expanding upper secondary education offers middle-income countries an effective way of improving adolescent health.",11,"['was defined', 'were found']",2,2,0.18181818181818182,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0156883,Secondary Education and Health Outcomes in Young People from the Cape Area Panel Study (CAPS)

Aim
Effective control of type 2 diabetes is predicated upon the ability of a person with diabetes to adhere to self-management activities. In order to develop and implement services that are locally relevant and culturally acceptable, it is critical to understand people’s experiences of living with the disease. We synthesized qualitative research evidence describing the views and experiences of persons with type 2 diabetes in Africa regarding diabetes self-management.



Methods
Five data bases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, SCOPUS and CINAHL) were searched for qualitative studies published between the year 2000 and December 2019. After study selection, the included papers were critically appraised using an established tool. The data were extracted, and findings were coded and analysed to identify descriptive and analytical themes using a thematic synthesis approach. This review was registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) with registration number CRD42018102255.



Results
Sixteen studies were included in this review, representing a total of 426 participants across seven countries. Synthesis of findings produced six analytical themes. The diagnosis of diabetes triggered a range of emotions and revealed culturally specific understandings of the condition that negatively affected self-management practices. People with diabetes seeking health care at hospitals encountered several challenges including long waiting times and costly diabetes treatment. Family support and a state of acceptance of the condition were identified as facilitators to diabetes self-management.



Conclusion
Effective self-management of type 2 diabetes is a challenge for most persons with diabetes in Africa. There is an urgent need for culturally appropriate education strategies and restructuring of the health system to facilitate self-management of diabetes.",14,"['is predicated', 'were searched', 'were critically appraised', 'were extracted', 'were coded', 'was registered', 'were included', 'were identified']",8,7,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240938,Factors influencing self-management in relation to type 2 diabetes in Africa: A qualitative systematic review

Aim
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has recently been implicated in thirst in rodent models. The mechanisms for this are currently uncertain, and it is unclear whether hydration status can alter FGF21 concentrations, potentially providing an additional mechanism by which hypohydration induces thirst. The aim of this study is therefore to understand whether hydration status can alter circulating FGF21 in humans.



Methods
Using a heat tent and fluid restriction, we induced hypohydration (1.9% body mass loss) in 16 healthy participants (n = 8 men), and compared their glycaemic regulation to a rehydration protocol (heat tent and fluid replacement) in a randomised crossover design.



Results
After the hypohydration procedure, urine specific gravity, urine and serum osmolality, and plasma copeptin (as a marker for arginine vasopressin) increased as expected, with no change after the rehydration protocol. In the fasted state, the median paired difference in plasma FGF21 concentrations from the rehydrated to hypohydrated trial arm was -37 (interquartile range -125, 10) pg∙mL-1(P = 0.278), with average concentrations being 458 ± 462 pg∙mL-1 after hypohydration and 467 ± 438 pg∙mL-1 after rehydration; mean difference -9 ± 173 pg∙mL-1.



Conclusion
To our knowledge, these are the first causal data in humans investigating hydration and FGF21, demonstrating that an acute bout of hypohydration does not impact fasted plasma FGF21 concentrations. These data may suggest that whilst previous research has found FGF21 administration can induce thirst and drinking behaviours, a physiological state implicated in increased thirst (hypohydration) does not appear to impact plasma FGF21 concentrations in humans.",8,"['been implicated', 'state implicated']",2,2,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0235557,The effect of hydration status on plasma FGF21 concentrations in humans: A subanalysis of a randomised crossover trial

Functional constipation (FC) is one of the common diseases among children. The aim of this study was to investigate the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in preschool children diagnosed with FC and the impact of the condition on affected families.



Methods
In this cross-sectional, case-control study, 152 children aged 3–6 years with FC, 176 healthy children aged 3–6 years without FC, and their primary caregivers were selected.  Chinese versions of the PedsQLTM 4.0 Generic Core Scale and the Family Impact Module (FIM) were used to assess childhood HRQOL and the impact of FC on family members, respectively. HRQOL scores were compared between children with FC and healthy children. In addition, a multiple step-wise regression with demographic variables of children and their caregivers, family economic status, duration and symptoms of FC, as independent variables, was used to determine factors that influenced HRQOL in children and had impacted caregivers.



Results
Scores of physical, emotional, social and school functions, and summary scales were significantly lower in children with FC than in healthy children (p < 0.05). Physical, emotional, social, cognitive, and communication scores for caregivers, as well as daily activities and relationships for families of children with FC, were significantly lower than those of caregivers and families with healthy children (p < 0.05). Children’s ages, duration of FC, symptoms of FC, the child-caregiver relationship, family economic status, and caregiver education level emerged as the main factors influencing HRQOL in children, caregivers, and family members. 



Conclusions
FC had a significant impact on HRQOL of affected children and their caregivers, as well as their family functions. Social characteristics of children and caregivers, duration and symptoms of FC and family economic status significantly affected HRQOL of children and caregivers, as well as family functions of children with FC.",12,"['children aged', 'were selected', 'were used', 'were compared', 'was used']",5,4,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0077273,"Impact of Functional Constipation on Health-Related Quality of Life in Preschool Children and Their Families in Xi’an, China"

Aim
Health-related quality of life is impaired in patients with autoimmune hepatitis, but the association between health-related quality of life and patients’ backgrounds remains unknown. We assessed health-related quality of life in patients with autoimmune hepatitis and identified factors associated with its impairment.



Methods
We assessed health-related quality of life in patients with autoimmune hepatitis, patients with chronic hepatitis C, and healthy subjects using the Japanese version of the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire and the 36-Item Short Form Survey. We compared health-related quality of life in patients with autoimmune hepatitis with that of patients with chronic hepatitis C and healthy subjects.



Results
A total of 265 patients with autoimmune hepatitis, 88 patients with chronic hepatitis C, and 97 healthy subjects were enrolled; most patients were women. The median ages of patients were 65, 66, and 57 years, respectively. Of these patients with autoimmune hepatitis, 10.6% and 57.0% had cirrhosis and comorbid diseases, respectively. The overall Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire scores (5.5 vs. 6.2, P < 0.001) and physical (48.1 vs. 54.2, P < 0.001) and mental (51.8 vs. 55.0, P = 0.004) component summaries of 36-Item Short Form Survey were significantly lower in patients with autoimmune hepatitis than in healthy subjects, and similar to scores in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Having cirrhosis, comorbid diseases, and treatment for autoimmune hepatitis were associated with impaired health-related quality of life among patients with autoimmune hepatitis. In particular, prednisolone use was associated with lower scores on the worry domain of the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire.



Conclusions
Patients with autoimmune hepatitis showed impairment in health-related quality of life, which was associated with not only disease progression, but also comorbid diseases and treatment. Ways to improve health-related quality of life should be considered in patients with AIH when disease outcome is not favorable and when using prednisolone.",10,"['were enrolled', 'should be considered']",2,2,0.2,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204772,Health-related quality of life in patients with autoimmune hepatitis: A questionnaire survey
"Abstract

Aim
In glaucoma, depression and disturbed sleep has been associated with degeneration of the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, that mediate non-image forming effects of light such as regulation of circadian rhythm, alertness and mood. In this study we assessed associations between seasonal mood and behavior variation and retinal ganglion cell damage in outpatients with glaucoma.



Methods
The seasonal pattern assessment questionnaire was administered to outpatients with glaucoma. Data on visual field defects identified by autoperimetry and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness visualized by ocular coherence tomography were collected from patient charts. The correlations between seasonality and retinal damage were tested and the adjusted effects of retinal function on seasonality were evaluated in a linear regression model.



Results
In total, 113 persons completed the questionnaire. Of these, 4% fulfilled the criteria for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and 8% for subsyndromal seasonal affective disorder (sSAD). Mean global seasonal score was 4.3. There were no significant correlations between seasonality and either visual field or retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. In the adjusted analysis there were trends toward differential effects of visual field on seasonality in subgroups with different sex and type of glaucoma.



Conclusion
There were no strong associations between seasonality and visual field or retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Sex, age and glaucoma subtype may modify light effects on complex regulatory systems.",13,"['was administered', 'were collected', 'were tested', 'were evaluated']",4,3,0.23076923076923078,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229991,Mood and behavior seasonality in glaucoma; assessing correlations between seasonality and structure and function of the retinal ganglion cells
"Abstract

Aim
In surveys non-responders may introduce bias and lower the validity of the studies. Ways to increase response rates are therefore important. The purpose of the study was to investigate if an unconditional monetary incentive can increase the response rate for vulnerable children and youths in a postal questionnaire survey.



Methods
The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. The study population consisted of 262 children and youth who participated in an established intervention study aimed at creating networks for different groups of vulnerable children and youths. The mean age of the participants was 16.7 years (range 11–28) and 67.9% were female. The questionnaire was adapted to three different age groups and covered different aspects of the participants’ life situation, including the dimensions from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). In the follow-up survey, participants were randomly allocated to two groups that either received a €15 voucher for a supermarket together with the questionnaire or only received the questionnaire. We used Poisson regression to estimate the differences in response rate (Rate Ratio RR) between the intervention group and the control group.



Results
The response rate was 75.5% in the intervention group and 42.9% in the control group. The response rate in the intervention group was significantly higher than in the control group when adjusting for age and gender (Rate Ratio, RR 1.73; 95% CI 1.38–2.17). We did not find any significant differences in scales scores between the two groups for the five scales of the SDQ. In stratified analyses, we found the effect of the incentive to be higher for males (RR 2.81; 95% CI 1.61–4.91) than for females (1.43; 95% CI 1.12–1.84).



Conclusions
Monetary incentives can increase the response rate for vulnerable children and youths in surveys.

Aim
In this paper we aimed to systematically review the literature on physical activity’s effect on depressive symptoms in Parkinson disease.



Background
Depression is a common symptom of Parkinson’s disease and is associated with increased disability, rapid progression of motor symptoms, mortality, and adverse effects on Quality of Life.



Design
A systematic review of primary research was undertaken and conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews.



Data sources
Databases Scopus, Psycho-info, CINAHL, PubMed, and ProQuest Cochrance were searched from January 2006 to June 2017. The language was restricted to English.



Review methods
Abstracts were screened and reviewed against the eligibility criteria (participants’ mean age were ≥ 60 with PD, PA interventions, depression as one of outcome variables, and Randomized Control Trail or quasi-experimental design). Two reviewers appraised the quality of the data extracted. The modified Jadad scale assessed the quality of the methodology of the published papers.



Results
The database search yielded 769 abstracts, 11 of which were included in this review and awarded scores ranging from 3 to 8 (Scale scores range from 0 to 8 points, higher scores indicated better quality) by the raters. These 11 studies included 342 patients and executed 17 kinds of physical activity programs. Results of this review show empirical evidence to support the efficacy of physical activity for the population with Parkinson’s disease. Aerobic training exercise significantly improved the participants’ scores on the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Quality of Life of the patients. Qigong improved scores in UPDRS-III and decreased incidences of multiple non-motor symptoms and depression. Furthermore, a balance-training program, such as Tai Chi, can improve postural stability and Quality of Life.



Conclusions
Physical activity may assuage the degeneration of motor skills and depression as well as increase the Quality of Life of Parkinson’s disease patients, with aerobic training producing the best results. These findings suggest that physical activity, notably aerobic training, could be a good exercise strategy for patients with Parkinson’s disease.",16,"['was undertaken', 'were searched', 'was restricted', 'were screened and reviewed against', 'were ≥', 'were included']",6,5,0.3125,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181515,Effectiveness of physical activity on patients with depression and Parkinson's disease: A systematic review
"Abstract

Aim
In view of the current context of poverty and socio-economic inequalities and the high and rising burdens of HIV infection and non-communicable diseases in South Africa, this study aims to describe the distribution of adverse life events (ALEs) by age and gender, and examine the socio-demographic characteristics, psychosocial coping mechanisms, risky lifestyle behaviours and family burden of HIV-related ill-health associated with ALEs in 25-74-year-old black residents of Cape Town.



Materials and methods
In a random cross-sectional sample, 12 ALEs, tobacco and alcohol use, sense of coherence (SOC), locus of control (LOC) and impact of HIV in the family were determined by administered questionnaires. Data analyses included descriptive statistics adjusted for the realised sample. Multivariable linear regression models assessed the independent associations of increasing number of ALEs.



Results
Among 1099 participants, mean lifetime score of ALE categories examined was 6.1 ±2.1 (range 0–12) with men reporting significantly higher number of events compared with women (p<0.001). The most frequent ALE was the death of a loved one (88.5%) followed by a major financial crisis (81.2%) with no trend across gender or age group. In the multivariable linear regression model, increasing ALEs were significantly associated with male gender, unemployment, having spent >50% of life in urban areas, >7 years of education, problematic alcohol use and poorer psychosocial coping mechanisms defined by low SOC and LOC. All four variables pertaining to HIV-related burden of ill-health in the family were significantly associated with increasing ALEs.



Conclusions
Considering that lower SOC and LOC and problem drinking were significantly linked to ALEs, policymakers need to formulate strategies that improve coping mechanisms and promote problem-solving behaviours, target the high burden of alcohol misuse and address unemployment.",9,"['were determined', 'were significantly linked']",2,2,0.2222222222222222,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0238320,A high burden of adverse life events and poor coping mechanisms experienced by urban-dwelling black South Africans
"Abstract

Aim
Knowledge is scarce regarding mothers’ and fathers’ experiences of being a parent of a child with VACTERL association—a complex malformation. The aim of the study was to describe experiences of being a parent of a child with VACTERL association.



Method
Semi-structured interviews were performed with ten mothers and nine fathers face-to-face or by telephone and analyzed by using Qualitative content analysis.



Results
The parents described crisis reactions at the discovery of malformations in their child. Involvement in care was reported from the initial hospital admission until actively taking responsibility for treatments at home. Eventually the health condition became an integrated part of everyday life. The parents expressed the importance of meeting other families with a child with VACTERL. Descriptions were given of more or less professionalism with perceived discrepancies of knowledge and experience between the healthcare professionals in the tertiary hospital and those in the local hospital. Difficulties in receiving medical support during the initial period at home were described. Furthermore, emotional support and practical arrangements regarding parental accommodation and transportation varied.



Conclusion
Being a parent of a child with VACTERL association involves crisis, mixed emotional reactions and shared responsibility for the child´s treatment and care with the professional care providers. Psychological processing, good medical care and support from experts, and peer support from other parents is essential in the parents’ struggle to reach self-confidence and adaptation. A care plan with individualized tailored care for each child including a training and support plan for the parents is warranted. To reduce the described discrepancies in knowledge and experience between the local and tertiary hospital, video sessions with the parents and responsible professionals at the local and tertiary hospital could be an appropriate mode of transferring information at discharge and follow up of the child.",14,"['were performed', 'was reported', 'were given', 'were described', 'is warranted']",5,5,0.35714285714285715,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0215751,From crisis to self-confidence and adaptation; Experiences of being a parent of a child with VACTERL association – A complex congenital malformation
"Abstract

Aim
Lack of knowledge concerning the nature of placebo and why it is necessary may influence the participation of patients in clinical trials. The objective of the present study is to review how placebo is described in written information for participants in clinical trials to be evaluated by a Human Research Ethics Committee.



Methods
All research protocols submitted for evaluation in a Spanish hospital during 2007–2013 were reviewed. The main characteristics of the studies using a placebo were collected. Three authors read each of them to determine how the term “placebo” was explained and if there was any comment on its efficacy and safety.



Results
Two thousand seven-hundred and forty research protocols were evaluated, of which three hundred and fifty-nine used a placebo. Pharmaceutical companies sponsored most placebo-controlled clinical trials (91.9%), and phase III studies were the commonest (59.9%). Oncology (15.0%), cardiology (14.2%), and neurology (13.1%) made the greatest contributions. A review of the informed consent forms showed that placebo was described in a similar manner in most studies: the explanation was limited to between four and eight words. Very few gave information about the risks of its use or adverse reactions from its administration. None of the studies provided details about the placebo effect. And 23 lacked any information about placebo at all.



Conclusions
Explanations about placebo in informed consent forms is often scarce, and information about the placebo effect and associated risks are absent. This situation may influence a full understanding of placebo by participants in clinical trials and might reduce their informed decision to participate.",14,"['is described', 'evaluated by a human research ethics committee', 'protocols submitted', 'were reviewed', 'were collected', 'was explained', 'were evaluated', 'was described', 'was limited']",9,6,0.42857142857142855,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0113654,The Definition of Placebo in the Informed Consent Forms of Clinical Trials
"Abstract

Aim
Life changes due to the sudden onset of acquired brain injury (ABI) are drastic personal and social changes that require adaptation and are also an important indicator of the quality of life of family caregivers. However, there are no instruments for evaluating life change adaptation among family caregivers of individuals with acquired brain injury. This study aimed to develop the Life Change Adaptation Scale (LCAS) for family caregivers of individuals with ABI and examine its reliability and validity.



Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-reported questionnaire. A total of 1622 family caregivers of individuals with ABI who belonged to 82 associations for families of individuals with ABI were selected as eligible participants. The construct validity was evaluated using a confirmatory factor analysis. Internal consistency was calculated using Cronbach’s alpha. The K6 was also administered to assess the criterion-related validity of the LCAS.



Results
In total, 339 valid responses were received. The confirmatory factor analysis identified eight items from two domains, “Changes in the appraisal of caregiving resources” and “Changes in the health belief as a caregiver” (goodness of fit index = 0.963, adjusted goodness of fit index = 0.926, comparative fit index = 0.986, root mean square error of approximation  = 0.043.) Cronbach’s alpha was 0.84. The LCAS was negatively correlated with the K6 (r = -0.504; P<0.001).



Conclusions
The LCAS is a brief, easy-to-administer instrument that is reliable and valid for family caregivers of individuals with ABI. This study contributes to the assessment and identification by family caregivers of individuals with ABI who require aid in adapting to life changes. Further research should be undertaken to verify the predictive value in a longitudinal study and to attempt to apply the LCAS to assess a broader range of subjects in a wider range of settings.",16,"['was conducted', 'were selected', 'was evaluated', 'was calculated', 'was also administered', 'were received', 'was negatively correlated', 'should be undertaken']",8,8,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0241386,Development of the life change adaptation scale for family caregivers of individuals with acquired brain injury
"Abstract

Aim
Long-term care systems may alleviate caregiver burdens, particularly for those with fewer resources. However, it remains unclear whether socioeconomic disparity in caregiver burdens exists under a public, universal long-term care insurance (LTCI) system. This study examined income-based inequalities in caregiving time and depressive symptoms in Japanese older family caregivers. We further compared inequality in depressive symptoms with that of non-caregivers to evaluate whether family caregiving exacerbates this disparity.



Methods
Data were obtained from a cross-sectional, nationwide survey conducted by the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study in 2013. Participants were functionally independent older adults aged ≥65 years (N = 21,584). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatrics Depression Scale (GDS); caregiving hours per week, household income, and other covariates were also assessed.



Results
Family caregivers occupied 8.3% of the total. A Poisson regression model revealed that caregivers in lower income groups (compared to those in the highest) were 1.32 to 1.95 and 1.63 to 2.68 times more likely to engage in ≥36 and ≥72 hours/week of caregiving, respectively. As for the GDS (≥5), an excess risk was found in the caregivers in lower (compared to higher) income groups (adjusted prevalence ratio: 1.57–3.10). However, an interaction effect of income by caregiving role indicated no significant difference in inequality between caregivers and non-caregivers (p = .603). The excess risk for GDS (≥5) in the caregivers compared to non-caregivers was observed across income groups.



Conclusions
Our findings revealed a possible disparity in family caregivers under the public LTCI system. Further studies should examine factors associated with longer caregiving hours in lower income households. Our findings also suggest the necessity for more efforts to alleviate depressive symptoms in family caregivers under the LTCI system regardless of income level, rather than exclusively supporting those with a low income.",15,"['were obtained', 'adults aged', 'were assessed', 'was found', 'was observed']",5,5,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194919,Income-based inequalities in caregiving time and depressive symptoms among older family caregivers under the Japanese long-term care insurance system: A cross-sectional analysis

Aim
Many case-control studies have been performed in the recent past to investigate the association between CCL5 -403 G>A (rs2107538) gene polymorphism and tuberculosis (TB) susceptibility in various ethnic groups. However, these studies have produced inconsistent and contradictory results. In the present study, meta-analysis was performed to assess the association between CCL5 -403 G>A polymorphism and TB risk.



Methodology
Quantitative synthesis was done for the published studies based upon association between CCL5 -403 G>A polymorphism and TB risk from PubMed (Medline), EMBASE web search. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for allele contrast, homozygous, heterozygous, dominant and recessive genetic models.



Results
A total of six studies comprising 1638 confirmed TB cases and 1519 healthy controls were included in this meta-analysis. Variant A allele (A vs. G: p = 0.035; OR = 1.301, 95% CI = 1.019 to 1.662) and variant homozygous (AA vs. GG; p = 0.001; OR = 1.520, 95% CI = 1.202 to 1.923) carriers were significantly associated with TB susceptibility. Similarly, recessive model (AA vs. GG+GA: p = 0.016; OR = 1.791, 95% CI = 1.117 to 2.873) also indicated increased TB risk. Whereas, heterozygous (GA vs. GG: p = 0.837; OR = 1.028, 95% CI = 0.791 to 1.335) and dominant (AA+GA vs. GG: p = 0.222; OR = 1.188, 95% CI = 0.901 to 1.567) models failed to show increased risk of developing TB.



Conclusions
This meta-analysis suggests that there is a significant association between the CCL5 -403 G>A polymorphism and increased risk of TB. However, larger well-designed epidemiological studies with stratified case control and biological characterization may be helpful to validate this association.",13,"['have been performed', 'was performed', 'was done', 'were calculated', 'were included']",5,5,0.38461538461538464,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0072139,A Meta-Analysis of the Association between the CC Chemokine Ligand 5 (CCL5) -403 G>A Gene Polymorphism and Tuberculosis Susceptibility

Aim
Metabolic risk factors are poorly documented for the first generation of young adults who have lived with HIV since childhood. We compared their metabolic profile with that of adults of same age from the general population.



Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from two populations: (1) COVERTE (ANRS-CO19), a French national cohort of 18 to 30-year-old patients HIV-infected since childhood, and (2) ENNS, a national cross-sectional population-based household survey on nutrition. Body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, waist circumference, fasting glucose, triglycerides, and HDL-, LDL- and total cholesterol were measured in both studies. Direct standardization on overweight and education level and logistic regression were used to compare the prevalence of metabolic abnormalities between the two populations.



Results
Data from 268 patients from COVERTE and 245 subjects from ENNS were analyzed. Tobacco use was similar in both groups. HIV-infected patients had increased mean waist-to-hip ratio and triglycerides to HDL-cholesterol ratio and decreased mean HDL-cholesterol as compared to their counterparts from the general population in both genders. In HIV-infected patients, metabolic syndrome was identified in 13.2% of men (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.1–19.2) and 10.4% (95% CI: 5.4–15.3) of women versus 10.6% (95%CI: 1.5–19.7) and 1.7% (95%CI: 0–4.1) in subjects from the general population, respectively.



Conclusion
Young adults infected with HIV since childhood had a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia and metabolically detrimental fat distribution than adults of same age of the general population, supporting close monitoring for cardiometabolic diseases.",10,"['are poorly documented', 'were measured', 'were used', 'were analyzed', 'was identified']",5,5,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0206745,Metabolic risk factors in young adults infected with HIV since childhood compared with the general population

Aim
Negative attitudes towards people with obesity are common even in health care settings. So far, the attitudes and causal beliefs of dietitians and nutritionists have not been investigated systematically. The aim of this article was to review the current state of quantitative research on weight-related stigma by dietitians and nutritionists.



Method
A systematic literature review was conducted in 2014 using PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Cochrane Library.



Results
Eight studies were found that differ in regard to study characteristics, instruments and the origin of the sample. Six out of eight studies reported weight stigma expressed by dietitians and nutritionists. Their believed causes of obesity indicated a defined preference for internal factors rather than genetics or biology.



Discussion
Results of studies were not homogenous. The degree of negative attitudes by dietitians and nutritionists towards people with obesity appeared to be slightly less pronounced compared to the general public and other health care professionals. Stigma and its consequences should be included into educational programs to optimally prepare dietitians and nutritionists.",10,"['been investigated', 'was conducted', 'were found', 'should be included']",4,4,0.4,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140276,Dietitians and Nutritionists: Stigma in the Context of Obesity.

Aim
Occupational exposure to styrene has been shown to be associated with an increased probability of developing hearing loss. However, the sites of lesions in the auditory system in humans remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible adverse effects of styrene exposure on the cochlea of human subjects.



Design
The hearing function of 98 styrene-exposed male workers from the glass fibre-reinforced plastics industry (mean concentration of 55 mg/m3) was evaluated bilaterally using pure-tone audiometry (1000–16000 Hz), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), and auditory brainstem response (ABR). The results were compared to a group of 111 male workers exposed to noise (above 85 dBA) and 70 male white-collar workers exposed to neither noise nor solvents. Age and noise exposure levels were accounted for as confounding variables in all statistical models.



Results
Styrene exposure was significantly associated with poorer pure-tone thresholds (1–8 kHz), lower DPOAE amplitudes (5–6 kHz), and shorter wave V latencies in both ears compared to control-group subjects. Similar results were found among noise-exposed subjects. A further analysis with wave V latency showed that styrene-exposed subjects showed significantly shorter latencies than expected according to normative data. These results suggest that occupational exposure to styrene at moderate concentrations is associated with cochlear dysfunction, at least at high frequencies. DPOAEs may be considered a valuable diagnostic tool in hearing conservation programs in workers exposed to styrene.",11,"['has been shown', 'was evaluated', 'were compared', 'were accounted', 'were found', 'may be considered']",6,6,0.5454545454545454,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227978,Cochlear dysfunction is associated with styrene exposure in humans

Aim
Personality Disorders (PD) often share clinical and phenomenological overlap with psychotic disorders, especially at onset. However, there is little research on comorbid PD among people experiencing first episode psychosis. We examined the prevalence of PD recording and its sociodemographic and clinical correlates in people accepted to Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) services.



Methods
Participants were aged 16–35, accepted into 6 EIP services for suspected psychosis, as part of the Social Epidemiology of Psychoses in East Anglia (SEPEA) study. PD was recorded by clinicians according to ICD-10. Multilevel logistic regression was performed.



Results
Of 798 participants, 76 people (9.5%) received a clinical diagnosis of PD, with emotionally unstable PD (75.0%, N = 57) the most common subtype. In multivariable analysis, risk factors for PD included female sex (odds ratio [OR]: 3.4; 95% CI: 2.0–5.7), absence of psychotic disorder after acceptance to EIP (OR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.6–5.5), more severe hallucinations (OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2–2.1), and lower parental SES (OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1–1.8). Compared with the white British, black and minority ethnic groups were less likely to receive a PD diagnosis (OR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1–0.7). There was no association between PD and neighbourhood-level deprivation or population-density.



Conclusions
Recording of a PD diagnosis was three times more common amongst participants later found not to meet threshold criteria for psychotic disorder, implying phenomenological overlap at referral which highlights difficulties encountered in accurate diagnostic assessment, treatment and onward referral. People with PD experienced more individual-level, but not neighbourhood-level social disadvantage in an already disadvantaged sample.",12,"['were aged', 'was recorded', 'was performed']",3,3,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0234047,Personality disorder in an Early Intervention Psychosis cohort: Findings from the Social Epidemiology of Psychoses in East Anglia (SEPEA) study
"Abstract

Aim
PTSD symptoms were pervasive among children and adolescents after experiencing or exposure to traumatic events. Screening and diagnosis of PTSD symptoms is crucial in trauma-related research and practice. The 13-item Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES) has been demonstrated to be a valid and reliable tool to achieve this goal. This study was designed to examine the psychometric properties of the 13-item CRIES in a sample of Chinese debris flood victims.



Methods
A total of 268 participants (145 girls, 123 boys) aged 8–18 years were recruited from an integral part of a service oriented project, supported by the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences following the debris flood. The participants were given the 13-item CRIES 3 months after the debris flood.



Results
The results of confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a two-factor structure (intrusion+arousal vs avoidance) emerged as the model best fit in total sample, boys and girls subsamples, respectively. The scale was also demonstrated to have good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.83).



Conclusion
The study confirmed the good psychometric properties of the CRIES and its' applicability to Chinese children and adolescents. Moreover, these findings imply that the CRIES factor structure is stable across age, gender, and different types of trauma.",10,"['has been demonstrated', 'was designed', 'were recruited', 'were given', 'was also demonstrated']",5,5,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0041741,Structure of the Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES) with Children and Adolescents Exposed to Debris Flood

Aim
Salivary cortisol, α-amylase (sAA), secretory IgA (sIgA), testosterone, and soluble fraction of receptor II of TNFα (sTNFαRII) could serve as objective pain measures, but the normal variability of these potential biomarkers is unknown.



Patients & Methods
Saliva was collected with the passive secretion method from 34, pain-free subjects in two single samples at least 24 hours apart. Biomarker variation and intersession reliability were assessed with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Also, we calculated the within-subject standard deviation (Sw) and the reproducibility (2.77 × Sw) of intersession measures.



Results
Salivary cortisol, sAA, sIgA, testosterone, and sTNFαRII yielded the following ICCs: 0.53, 0.003, 0.88, 0.42 and 0.83, respectively. We found no statistically significant systematic differences between sessions in any biomarker except for testosterone, which showed a decrease on the second day (p<0.001). The reproducibility for salivary cortisol, sAA, sIgA, testosterone, and sTNFαRII were 0.46 ng/ml, 12.88 U/ml, 11.7 μg/ml, 14.54 pg/ml and 18.29 pg/ml, respectively. Cortisol, testosterone and TNFαRII measurement variability showed a positive correlation with the magnitude (p<0.002), but no relationship was found for sAA and sIgA.



Conclusions
Salivary sIgA and sTNFαRII show a remarkable good reproducibility and, therefore, could be useful as pain biomarkers. When using the passive secretion method, intersession variations in salivary sIgA of more than 11.7 μg/ml may reflect true biomarker change. In the case of sTNFαRII this will depend of the magnitude. The estimates herein provided should help investigators and clinicians differentiate actual biomarker modification from measurement variability.",12,"['was collected', 'were assessed', 'was found']",3,3,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0166976,Reliability of Potential Pain Biomarkers in the Saliva of Healthy Subjects: Inter-Individual Differences and Intersession Variability
"Abstract

Aim
The aim of our study was to investigate factors associated with burnout of nurses and care workers in nursing homes and geriatric hospitals in Japan. The use of Buddhist priests, the major religion in Japan, was also explored.



Methods
Questionnaires for nurses and care workers were sent to 10 care facilities. The survey questions included basic demographic information, the Japanese Burnout Index and the Japanese version of the Frommelt Attitude Toward Care Of Dying Scale Form B. They also asked questions about use of Buddhist priests for tasks such as helping to manage the anxiety or distress of patients, families, and staff, or providing sutra chanting.



Results
In total, 323 questionnaires were returned, of which 260 were used for analysis. Only 18 (6.9%) answered that they had any religious beliefs, which was relatively low compared to 27% from governmental survey data. In total, however, 71% expressed a need for Buddhist priests to help with anxiety or distress among patients. A positive attitude towards providing end-of-life care was a protective factor against depersonalization. It was, however, also related to lower feelings of personal accomplishment.



Conclusion
Care homes and geriatric hospitals may want to consider calling more on religious resources as a support for staff and patients.",10,"['was also explored', 'were sent', 'were returned', 'were used']",4,3,0.3,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202277,A positive attitude towards provision of end-of-life care may protect against burnout: Burnout and religion in a super-aging society
"Abstract

Aim
The aim of the present study was to examine whether listening to music during warming-up might influence short-term maximal performance (STMP), cognitive anxiety, self-confidence, and enjoyment during Ramadan, and whether these affects might predict STMP.



Methods
Nine male physical education students (age: 21 ± 1.1 years; height: 1.8 ± 0.04 m; body mass: 83 ± 5 kg) volunteered to participate in the present study. A within-subjects design consisted of four experimental sessions: Two sessions occurred one week before Ramadan and two others took place during Ramadan. They were scheduled at 5 p.m. and were conducted as follows: After a 10-minute warm-up either with or without listening to music, each participant performed a 5-m multiple shuttle run test, after which he was asked to answer items intended to assess his affective state during the experimental task.



Results
Our findings revealed that STMP was lower during Ramadan than before Ramadan in the no-music condition. Additionally, it was found that STMP was higher in the music condition than in the no-music condition during Ramadan, and that STMP measured before Ramadan did not differ from that measured during Ramadan in the music condition. Regarding affects, the findings revealed that enjoyment was lower during Ramadan than before Ramadan in the music condition, and that cognitive anxiety was lower in the music condition than in the no-music condition before Ramadan. Self-confidence was not influenced by the experimental conditions.



Conclusion
This study showed that listening to music during warming-up not only would be beneficial for STMP in Ramadan fasters, but also would counteract the negative effects of Ramadan observance on STMP.",8,"['were scheduled', 'were conducted', 'was asked', 'was found', 'was not influenced']",5,3,0.375,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136400,Listening to Music during Warming-Up Counteracts the Negative Effects of Ramadan Observance on Short-Term Maximal Performance
"Abstract

Aim
The aim of the present study was to explore if children who spend more time on screen-based sedentary behaviors (i.e.TV viewing and computer use) drink more sugar-sweetened soft drinks. The study also assessed whether these associations were independent of individual and home environmental correlates of soft drink consumption and whether they were moderated by parental education.



Methods
Data were collected from 7886 children participating in the EuropeaN Energy balance Research to prevent excessive weight Gain among Youth (ENERGY) survey conducted in eight European countries. Self-report questionnaires were used. Multilevel linear regression analyses with soft drink consumption as dependent variable, TV viewing and computer use as independent variables and age, gender, parental education, attitude towards soft drinks, self-efficacy, parental modelling, parental rules and home availability of soft drinks as covariates were conducted. Further interactions were tested to explore if these associations were moderated by parental education. Country-specific analyses were conducted.



Results
In six of the eight included countries, a significant positive association was observed between TV viewing (min/day) and soft drink consumption (ml/day), independent of individual and home environmental correlates of soft drink consumption (B = 0.46 (0.26–0.66) in Greece, B = 0.77 (0.36–1.17) in Norway, B = 0.82 (0.12–1.51) in Hungary, B = 1.06 (0.67–1.46) in Spain, B = 1.21 (0.67–1.74) in Belgium and B = 1.49 (0.72–2.27) in Switzerland). There was no significant association between computer use and soft drink consumption in six of the eight included countries in the final models. Moderation effects of parental education in the association between TV viewing and soft drink consumption were found in Norway and Hungary, the association being stronger among those with low parental education.



Conclusions
TV viewing appears to be independently associated with soft drink consumption and this association was moderated by parental education in two countries only. Reducing TV time might therefore favorably impact soft drink consumption.",12,"['were moderated', 'were collected', 'were used', 'were conducted', 'were tested', 'moderated by parental education', 'were conducted', 'was observed', 'were found', 'was moderated']",10,9,0.75,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171537,Screen-based sedentary time: Association with soft drink consumption and the moderating effect of parental education in European children: The ENERGY study

Aim
The aim of the present work is to analyze the modulation of the brain activity within the areas involved in lipreading when an additional visual stimulus is included.



Methods
The experiment consisted of two fMRI runs (lipreading_only and lipreading+picture) where two conditions were considered in each one (oral speech sentences condition [OSS] and oral speech syllables condition [OSSY]).



Results
During lipreading-only, higher activity in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) was identified for OSS than OSSY; during lipreading+picture, apart from the left MTG, higher activity was also present in the supplementary motor area (SMA), the left precentral gyrus (PreCG) and the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). The comparison between these two runs revealed higher activity for lipreading-only in the SMA and the left IFG.

Aim
The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis suggesting that the pre-intervention levels of proinflammatory cytokines, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and angiogenic growth factors predict the long-term clinical results of autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell (ABMMC) transplantation in patients with primary ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).



Methods and results
From 2003 to 2006, a total of 62 patients with primary STEMI were enrolled in an open randomized study registered under the title ESTABOMA. Patients were randomized into two groups: group 1 included patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and ABMMC transplantation (n = 28); group 2 comprised patients treated only with PCI (n = 34). Follow-up study was performed 7.96 ± 0.96 years after STEMI and involved physical examination, six-minute walk test, echocardiography, and determination of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. The total and cardiovascular mortality rates were higher in group 1 compared with group 2: 36% (n = 10) vs. 12% (n = 4) (p = 0.02) and 29% (n = 8) vs. 6% (n = 2) (p = 0.03), respectively. Lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines were observed in group 1 after PCI and ABMMC transplantation. Serum levels of FGF, VEGF, and IL-10, determined before PCI and ABMMC transplantation were prognostically significant long-term indicators of unfavorable course of CAD after STEMI.",7,"['were enrolled', 'were randomized', 'was performed', 'were observed']",4,4,0.5714285714285714,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0176900,"Relationships of growth factors, proinflammatory cytokines, and anti-inflammatory cytokines with long-term clinical results of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell transplantation in STEMI"

Aim
The aim of this meta-analysis was to analyze the efficacy and safety of antidepressants for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.



Methods
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus and The Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy and safety of antidepressants in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Article quality was evaluated by Jadad score. RevMan 5.0 and Stata 12.0 were used for the meta-analysis.



Results
Twelve randomized controlled trials were included in this study and most of these trials were of high quality (Jadad score ≥4). Five articles focused on tricyclic antidepressants, six articles involved selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and one article investigated both types of treatment. The pooled risk ratio showed antidepressant treatment can improve global symptoms (RR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.08, 1.77). In the subgroup analysis, treatment with tricyclic antidepressants showed an improvement in global symptoms (RR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.07, 1.71), while treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors showed no statistically significant difference in global symptoms compared with the control groups (RR = 1.38, 95% CI 0.83, 2.28). The pooled risk ratio of dropout due to side effects following antidepressant treatment was 1.71 with 95% CI (0.98, 2.99). The subgroup analysis showed the pooled risk ratio of dropout in the tricyclic antidepressants group was 1.92 with 95% CI (0.89, 4.17). In the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors group, the pooled risk ratio of dropout was 1.5 with 95% CI (0.67, 3.37). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors showed no benefit in alleviating abdominal pain and improving quality of life. There was no difference in the incidence of common adverse events between treatment and control groups.



Conclusions
TCAs can improve global symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, while there was no strong evidence to confirm the effectiveness of SSRIs for the treatment of IBS.",14,"['was evaluated', 'were used', 'were included']",3,3,0.21428571428571427,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127815,Efficacy and Safety of Antidepressants for the Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Meta-Analysis
"Abstract

Aim
The aim of this study is to assess the depression of pregnant women in the aftermath of an earthquake, and to identify the social support that they obtained, their coping styles and socio-demographic factors associated with depression.



Methods
A total of 128 pregnant women from three hospitals in the epicenter area were recruited immediately after the Ya’an earthquake. Their depression was investigated using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) with a cutoff score of 14; the social support that they obtained was measured using the Social Support Questionnaire; and their coping styles were assessed using the Coping Styles Questionnaire.



Results
Immediately after the earthquake, the incidence rate of depression in pregnant women was 35.2%, higher than that of the general pregnant population (7%-14%). The EPDS scores were significantly correlated with gestation age at the time of the earthquake, objective support, subjective support, use of support, negative coping style, and positive coping style. The regression analysis indicated that risk factors of prenatal depression include the number of children, relatives wounded, subjective support, and coping styles. A further analysis of the interaction between social support and two types of coping styles with depression showed that there was interaction effect between subjective social support and positive coping styles in relation to EPDS scores. There was an inverse relationship between low EPDS scores and positive coping styles and high social support, and vice versa.



Conclusion
The timing of the occurrence of the earthquake may not necessarily affect the progress of the illness and recovery from depression, and psychological intervention could be conducted in the immediate aftermath after the earthquake. The impact of coping styles on prenatal depression appeared to be linked with social support. Helping pregnant women to adopt positive coping styles with good social support after a recent major earthquake, which is a stressor, may reduce their chances of developing prenatal depression.",11,"['were recruited', 'was investigated', 'was measured', 'were assessed', 'were significantly correlated', 'could be conducted', 'be linked']",7,5,0.45454545454545453,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0135809,"Depression, Social Support, and Coping Styles among Pregnant Women after the Lushan Earthquake in Ya’an, China"
"Abstract

Aim
The aim of this study is to examine emotional processing of infant displays in people with Eating Disorders (EDs).



Background
Social and emotional factors are implicated as causal and maintaining factors in EDs. Difficulties in emotional regulation have been mainly studied in relation to adult interactions, with less interest given to interactions with infants.



Method
A sample of 138 women were recruited, of which 49 suffered from Anorexia Nervosa (AN), 16 from Bulimia Nervosa (BN), and 73 were healthy controls (HCs). Attentional responses to happy and sad infant faces were tested with the visual probe detection task. Emotional identification of, and reactivity to, infant displays were measured using self-report measures. Facial expressions to video clips depicting sad, happy and frustrated infants were also recorded.



Results
No significant differences between groups were observed in the attentional response to infant photographs. However, there was a trend for patients to disengage from happy faces. People with EDs also reported lower positive ratings of happy infant displays and greater subjective negative reactions to sad infants. Finally, patients showed a significantly lower production of facial expressions, especially in response to the happy infant video clip. Insecure attachment was negatively correlated with positive facial expressions displayed in response to the happy infant and positively correlated with the intensity of negative emotions experienced in response to the sad infant video clip.



Conclusion
People with EDs do not have marked abnormalities in their attentional processing of infant emotional faces. However, they do have a reduction in facial affect particularly in response to happy infants. Also, they report greater negative reactions to sadness, and rate positive emotions less intensively than HCs. This pattern of emotional responsivity suggests abnormalities in social reward sensitivity and might indicate new treatment targets.",16,"['are implicated', 'have been mainly studied', 'were recruited', 'were tested', 'were measured', 'were also recorded', 'were observed', 'was negatively correlated']",8,8,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0113191,Emotional Processing of Infants Displays in Eating Disorders

Aim
The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of an 8-week multimodal physiotherapy programme (MPP), integrating physical land-based therapeutic exercise (TE), adapted swimming and health education, as a treatment for patients with chronic non-specific neck pain (CNSNP), on disability, general health/mental states and quality of life.



Methods
175 CNSNP patients from a community-based centre were recruited to participate in this prospective study. Intervention: 60-minute session (30 minutes of land-based exercise dedicated to improving mobility, motor control, resistance and strengthening of the neck muscles, and 30 minutes of adapted swimming with aerobic exercise keeping a neutral neck position using a snorkel). Health education was provided using a decalogue on CNSNP and constant repetition of brief advice by the physiotherapist during the supervision of the exercises in each session. Study outcomes: primary: disability (Neck Disability Index); secondary: physical and mental health states and quality of life of patients (SF-12 and EuroQoL-5D respectively). Differences between baseline data and that at the 8-week follow-up were calculated for all outcome variables.



Results
Disability showed a significant improvement of 24.6% from a mean (SD) of 28.2 (13.08) at baseline to 16.88 (11.62) at the end of the 8-week intervention. All secondary outcome variables were observed to show significant, clinically relevant improvements with increase ranges between 13.0% and 16.3% from a mean of 0.70 (0.2) at baseline to 0.83 (0.2), for EuroQoL-5D, and from a mean of 40.6 (12.7) at baseline to 56.9 (9.5), for mental health state, at the end of the 8-week intervention.



Conclusion
After 8 weeks of a MPP that integrated land-based physical TE, health education and adapted swimming, clinically-relevant and statistically-significant improvements were observed for disability, physical and mental health states and quality of life in patients who suffer CNSNP. The clinical efficacy requires verification using a randomised controlled study design.

"Abstract

Aim
The aim of this study was to assess the association between depression symptom severity and household income, consumption, asset-based wealth, debt and use of distress financing strategies, to understand how depression symptom severity and household economic welfare are related.



Methods
A household survey was administered to the households of primary health clinic-attenders who were screened for depression symptoms using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire in the chronic care units of four primary health clinics in the North West province of South Africa. Univariate and multivariable regression models were used to assess whether a range of household economic measures were significant predictors of depression symptom severity; and whether depression symptom severity significantly predicted changes to household economic welfare, across a number of different economic measures using both multiple linear regression and logistic regression analyses.



Results
On univariate analysis, certain characteristics were associated with significantly worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores, namely: households in which the household head was younger, female, and unmarried; households in which the indexed patient was younger, and did not receive an education beyond primary school; increasing household size, receipt of a social grant, households living in housing constructed of metal sheet walls and households making use of a public tap as their primary water source. In addition, univariate analysis demonstrated that higher log-transformed food expenditure, lower log-transformed capacity to pay, the presence of household debt and both reducing the size or frequency of meals and drawing up retail shop accounts in response to financial distress over the past three years were associated with significantly worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that larger household sizes (p<0.05), receipt of social grants (p<0.05), higher food expenditure (p<0.01), and drawing up retail shop accounts in response to financial distress (p<0.05) were independently predictive of worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores. Inversely, increasing age of the household head (p<0.05), having piped water directly into the household (as opposed to making use of a public water sources) (p<0.01), and increasing capacity to pay (p<0.01) were independently predictive of better (lower) PHQ-9 scores. Similarly, multivariable analysis demonstrated that worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores were independently predictive of lower household capacity to pay (p<0.10) and higher food expenditure (p<0.01).



Conclusions
This study is the first of its kind in South Africa, identifying household economic factors associated with increased depression symptom severity on a continuum; and demonstrating that financial risk protection efforts are needed across this continuum. The study demonstrates that the relationship between poverty and mental health extends beyond the individual to affect household economic functioning. These findings must be included in policy considerations to achieve effective protection for vulnerable households facing the interaction of depression and adverse economic circumstances.",13,"['are related', 'was administered', 'were screened', 'were used', 'are needed', 'must be included']",6,5,0.38461538461538464,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0224799,The household economic costs associated with depression symptoms: A cross-sectional household study conducted in the North West province of South Africa

Aim
The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence and persistence of clinically significant neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in nursing home residents with dementia, and to study the association between severity of dementia and specific neuropsychiatric sub-syndromes over time.



Methods
In total, 583 residents with dementia were included at admission to a nursing home and followed with biannual assessments until death, or to 30-month follow-up. At the end of the 30-month follow-up, 305 participants had died and 57 had left the study for other reasons, leaving 221 residents in the study. We collected data on demographics, cognition, severity of dementia, NPS, personal activities of daily living (P-ADL), physical health, medication and type of nursing home unit. NPS was assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), the Nursing Home version.



Results
The prevalence and persistence at two consecutive time-points of clinically significant NPS was high during the study period. The mean NPI agitation sub-syndrome score increased during the study period, while the NPI affective and psychosis sub-syndrome scores remained unchanged. More severe dementia was associated with higher NPI agitation, psychosis and affective sub-syndrome scores. The association remained unchanged over time for agitation and psychosis. For the NPI affective sub-syndrome, the association was stronger at the beginning, and declined towards the end of the study period.



Conclusion
The findings of high prevalence and persistence at two consecutive time points of clinically significant NPS over time, and the associations between severity of dementia and NPI sub-syndromes shed light on the burden and care needs of nursing home residents with dementia after admission to nursing home care. This information is of interest to health care planners and providers to enable them to increase the quality of care for nursing home residents.",12,"['were included', 'was assessed']",2,2,0.16666666666666666,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0206147,The course of neuropsychiatric symptoms in nursing home residents from admission to 30-month follow-up

Aim
The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity, reliability and sensitivity of the disease-specific items of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life-36 (KDQOL-36) in Chinese patients undergoing maintenance dialysis.



Methods
The content validity was assessed by content validity index (CVI) in ten subjects. 356 subjects were recruited for pilot psychometric testing. The internal construct validity was assessed by corrected item-subscale total correlation. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to confirm the factor structure. The convergent validity was assessed by Pearson’s correlation test between the disease specific subscale scores and SF-12 version 2 Health Survey (SF-12 v2) scores. The reliability was assessed by the internal consistency (Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient) and 2-week test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)). The sensitivity was determined by performing known group comparisons by independent t-test.



Results
The CVI on clarity and relevance was ≥ 0.9 for all items. Corrected item- total correlation scores were ≥0.4 for all, except an item related to problems with access site. CFA confirmed the 3-factor structure of the disease-specific component of the KDQOL-36. The correlation coefficients between the disease-specific domain scores and the SF-12 v2 physical and mental component summary scores ranged from 0.328 to 0.492. The reliability was good (Cronbach’s alpha coefficients ranged from 0.810 to 0.931, ICC ranged from 0.792 to 0.924). Only the effect subscale was sensitive in detecting differences in HRQOL between haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, with effect size = 0.68.

"Abstract

Aim
The aim of this study was to explore how Kalenjin women in rural Uasing Gishu County in Kenya perceive antenatal care and how their perceptions impede or motivate earlier access and continuous use of antenatal care services.



Methods
A study was conducted among 188 pregnant and post-natal mothers seeking care in 23 rural public health facilities. Gestational age at the initial antenatal care booking was established from their medical cards. Further researcher-administered questionnaire with closed and open-ended questions was used. Key informant interviews with traditional birth attendants (n = 6) and maternal and child health nursing officers (n = 6) were also conducted for triangulation. Descriptive statistics were applied using SPSS programme. The interviews of women who gave consent to be audio recorded (n = 52) were transcribed and thematically analysed using MAXQDA program, based on Andersen and Newman’s (1973) behavioural model of health services utilization.



Results
The mean gestational age at booking initial biomedical care was 23.36 weeks. Only 18 patients (10%) booked before 13 weeks and 45% made four or more visits. The main reasons given for early booking were: illness in index pregnancy (42%) checking the foetus position and monitoring foetus progress (7%). The main reasons given for late booking were: no reason (31%), was not feeling sick (16%), fear or shame due to unexpected pregnancy (13%). Almost half of the respondents (44%) used both biomedical and traditional antenatal care services. Main reasons for visiting traditional care were to: check foetus position and reposition it (63%), collect medicinal herbs (31%), relief discomforts through massage (18%).



Conclusion
Early antenatal care booking is meant for women with unpleasant physical signs and symptoms. Later ANC is meant to check foetus position and reposition it to cephalic presentation and monitor its progress and this is only possible if the foetus is large.",15,"['was conducted', 'was established', 'was used', 'were also conducted', 'were applied', 'were transcribed', 'is meant', 'is meant']",8,8,0.5333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202895,"“I should have started earlier, but I was not feeling ill!” Perceptions of Kalenjin women on antenatal care and its implications on initial access and differentials in patterns of antenatal care utilization in rural Uasin Gishu County Kenya"

Aim
The aim of this study was to explore the current and potential use of information and communication technology (ICT) to enhance coherent person-centred rehabilitation after stroke, from the perspectives of physiotherapists and occupational therapists.



Method
Five occupational therapists and four physiotherapists from different phases of the Danish stroke rehabilitation process were included and two focus group interviews were carried out. A grounded theory approach was used throughout the study and a constant comparative method was used in the analysis.



Results
Three subcategories were identified from the analysis of interviews with participants: 1) ICT and apps as meaningful and supportive in the rehabilitation process, 2) ICT as a tool in communication and documentation and 3) Barriers to the integration of ICT and apps in the rehabilitation process. From these categories one core category emerged: The potential of a personalized app solution to facilitate coherent person-centred rehabilitation.



Conclusion
ICT was perceived as important to integrate in stroke rehabilitation both for assessment, training and to compensate for remaining deficits. The development of a personalized app solution could accommodate stroke survivors’ and significant others’ need for insight into and overview over the rehabilitation process as well as access to relevant information, which would thereby empower them. Furthermore, a personalized app solution could also facilitate follow-up after discharge and was perceived to ease the communication and documentation within and between sectors, as well as communication with both stroke survivors and significant others.",8,"['were included', 'were carried', 'was used', 'was used', 'were identified', 'was perceived', 'was perceived']",7,5,0.625,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0236831,Physiotherapists’ and occupational therapists’ perspectives on information and communication technology in stroke rehabilitation

Aim
The aim of this study was to explore the general public’s perception of schizophrenia symptoms and the need to seek-help for symptoms. The recognition (or ‘labelling’) of schizophrenia symptoms, help-seeking behaviours and public awareness of schizophrenia have been suggested as potentially important factors relating to untreated psychosis.



Method
Participants were asked to rate to what extent they believe vignettes describing classic symptoms (positive and negative) of schizophrenia indicate mental illness. They were also asked if the individuals depicted in the vignettes required help or treatment and asked to suggest what kind of help or treatment.



Results
Only three positive symptoms (i.e., Hallucinatory behaviour, Unusual thought content and Suspiciousness) of schizophrenia were reasonably well perceived (above 70%) as indicating mental illness more than the other positive or negative symptoms. Even when the participants recognised that the symptoms indicated mental illness, not everyone recommended professional help.



Conclusion
There may be a need to improve public awareness of schizophrenia and psychosis symptoms, particularly regarding an awareness of the importance of early intervention for psychosis.",7,"['have been suggested', 'were asked', 'were also asked', 'were reasonably well perceived']",4,4,0.5714285714285714,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052913,Are Lay People Good at Recognising the Symptoms of Schizophrenia?

Logistic regression analysis was then performed to identify the factors associated with those who reported expressing emotional distress online and the differences in help-seeking behavior among four groups of youths: (1) the non-distressed (reference) group; (2) “Did not seek help” group; (3) “Seek informal help” group; and (4) “Seek formal help” group.



Results
The seeking of help and expression of distress online were found to be associated with a higher lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation. The “Seek formal help” and “Did not seek help” groups had a similar risk profile, including a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation, non-suicidal self-injury, unsafe sex, and being bullied. The “Seek informal help” group was more likely to express distress online, which indicates that this population of youths may be accessible to professional identification. Approximately 20% of the distressed youths surveyed had not sought help despite expressing their distress online.



Implication
The study’s results indicate that helping professionals have opportunities to develop strategic engagement methods that make use of social media to help distressed youths.",9,"['was conducted', 'was then performed', 'were found', 'being bullied']",4,4,0.4444444444444444,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0189023,Engagement of vulnerable youths using internet platforms

Aim
The aim of this study was to investigate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of a Chinese population with Barrett's esophagus (BE).



Methods
Data from subjects with BE from a single hospital were prospectively collected from October 2012 to December 2014. The exclusion criteria included total esophagectomy, severe cardiopulmonary deficiency, malignancy, or other unsuitable conditions for scope. All the enrolled cases were asked to complete the Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ), the short form-12, (SF-12), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).



Results
In total, 139 subjects were enrolled, and the mean age of the cases was 61.85 years old. Most subjects had short-segment BE (SSBE) (92.8%) and non-dysplastic BE tissue (94.2%). The mean physical and mental composite scores, PCS and MCS, of SF-12 were 44.14 and 45.53, respectively. The SF-12 scores in BE individuals were similar in men and women, elderly and non-elderly, LSBE and SSBE, coexisting EE and no-EE, and dysplastic and non-dysplastic. The appearance of reflux symptoms tended to decrease SF-12 scores in affected individuals, especially heartburn. The rates of anxiety and depression accounted for 25.2% and 17.3% of these cases, respectively.



Conclusion
Our study found HRQoL in BE patients was strongly associated with presentation of reflux symptoms.",11,"['were prospectively collected', 'were asked', 'were enrolled']",3,3,0.2727272727272727,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0190201,Health-related quality of life of subjects with Barrett's esophagus in a Chinese population

Aim
The aim of this study was to quantify gender-specific facial characteristics in younger and older adults and to determine how aging and body characteristics, such as height and body-mass index (BMI), influence facial sexual dimorphism.



Methods
The cohort study included 90 younger adults of Caucasian origin (average age of 45 females 23.2 ± 1.9 and 45 males 23.7 ± 2.4 years) and 90 older adults (average age of 49 females 78.1 ± 8.1 and 41 males 74.5 ± 7.7 years). Three-dimensional facial scans were performed with an Artec MHT 3D scanner. The data were analyzed using the software package Rapidform®. The parameters to evaluate facial symmetry, height, width, profile, facial shape, nose, eyes and mouth characteristics were determined based on 39 facial landmarks. Student’s t-test was used to calculate the statistical differences between the genders in the younger and older adults and a multiple-linear-regression analysis was used to evaluate the impact of gender, age, body-mass index and body height.



Results
We found that the female faces were more symmetrical than the male faces, and this was statistically significant in the older adults. The female facial shape was more rounded and their faces were smaller, after normalizing for body size. The males had wider mouths, longer upper lips, larger noses and more prominent lower foreheads. Surprisingly, we found that all the gender-dependent characteristics were even more pronounced in the older adults. Increased facial asymmetry, decreased facial convexity, increased forehead angle, narrower vermilions and longer inter-eye distances occurred in both genders during aging. An increased BMI was associated with wider faces, more concave facial profiles and wider noses, while greater body height correlated with increased facial heights and wider mouths.



Conclusion
Facial sexual dimorphism was confirmed by multiple parameters in our study, while the differences between the genders were more pronounced in the older adults.",13,"['were performed', 'were analyzed', 'were determined', 'was used', 'was used', 'was confirmed']",6,5,0.38461538461538464,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0231983,Effect of aging and body characteristics on facial sexual dimorphism in the Caucasian Population
"Abstract

Aim
The aim of this systematic review was to summarize and critically appraise the quality of published literature on measurement properties of questionnaires assessing Cognitive Reserve (CR) in adults (>18 years).



Methods
We systematically searched for published studies on MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science through August 2018. We evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies and the results on measurement properties based on a consensus-based standard checklist.



Results
The search strategy identified 991 publications, of which 37 were selected evaluating the measurement properties of six different questionnaires. Construct validity of the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire was most extensively evaluated, while evaluation of the remaining measurement properties of this questionnaire was scarce. Measurement properties of the Cognitive Reserve Questionnaire and the Cognitive Reserve Scale were assessed more completely. While the Lifetime of Experience Questionnaire seems to be the most thorough instrument, a finale recommendation for one specific questionnaire cannot be drawn, since about half of the measurement properties for each questionnaire were poorly or not assessed at all.



Conclusions
There is a need of high quality methodological studies assessing measurement properties of CR questionnaires, especially regarding content validity, structural validity, and responsiveness.

"Abstract

Aim
The aims of this literature review were to better understand the current literature about person-centred care (PCC) and identify a clear definition of the term PCC relevant to nursing practice.



Method/Data sources
An integrative literature review was undertaken using The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medline, Scopus and Pubmed databases. The limitations were English language, full text articles published between 1998 and 2018 within Australian, New Zealand, Canada, USA, Europe, Ireland and UK were included. The international context off PCC is then specifically related to the Australian context.



Review methods
The review adopted a thematic analysis to categorise and summarise themes with reference to the concept of PCC. The review process also adhered to the Preferred Reporting System for Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and applied the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tools to ensure the quality of the papers included for deeper analysis.



Results
While definitions of PCC do exist, there is no universally used definition within the nursing profession. This review has found three core themes which contribute to how PCC is understood and practiced, these are People, Practice and Power. This review uncovered a malalignment between the concept of PCC and the operationalisation of the term; this misalignment was discovered at both the practice level, and at the micro, meso and micro levels of the healthcare service.



Conclusion
The concept of PCC is well known to nurses, yet ill-defined and operationalised into practice. PCC is potentially hindered by its apparent rhetorical nature, and further investigation of how PCC is valued and operationalised through its measurement and reported outcomes is needed. Investigation of the literature found many definitions of PCC, but no one universally accepted and used definition. Subsequently, PCC remains conceptional in nature, leading to disparity between how it is interpreted and operationalised within the healthcare system and within nursing services.",13,"['was undertaken', 'articles published', 'were included', 'is understood', 'was discovered', 'is potentially hindered', 'is valued', 'is needed', 'is interpreted']",9,6,0.46153846153846156,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229923,Whose centre is it anyway?

Aim
The increasing burden of comorbid HIV infection and hypertension necessitates a focus on healthcare services providing care for chronic multi-morbidities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the perceptions and experiences of 1) people living with HIV infection and comorbid hypertension, and 2) their healthcare providers, related to their diagnoses and interactions with chronic healthcare services in South Africa.



Methods
This study comprised quantitative and qualitative arms with a multi-layered approach. We randomly selected 17 public healthcare facilities providing HIV care across Cape Town and surrounding rural municipalities.



Results
Interviews were conducted with clinicians (n = 11), specialised nursing professionals (n = 10), lay counsellors (n = 12), six patients focus groups (n = 35) and 20 in-depth individual patient interviews. There were mixed views on being treated at integrated vs. separate chronic care facilities regarding quality of care and privacy/anonymity. Specialised clinics offered better care for HIV infection while hypertension and other non-communicable diseases were neglected. Privacy about HIV status maybe better maintained in integrated clinics but not if status was disclosed by having the green-coloured HIV treatment card. A single appointment date was considered advantageous as it saved time and money leading to greater compliance; however, waiting times at clinics were longer with perhaps fewer patients seen.



Conclusions
The mixed reactions elicited to the integration of healthcare services for HIV, hypertension and other non-communicable diseases highlights the complexities involved in implementing such services. Greater human resources with retraining and reskilling of healthcare staff is required for the optimal management of chronic multi-morbidities.",11,"['were conducted', 'being treated', 'were neglected', 'was disclosed', 'was considered', 'reactions elicited', 'is required']",7,7,0.6363636363636364,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0235710,Care and management of a double burden of chronic diseases: Experiences of patients and perceptions of their healthcare providers
"Abstract

Aim
The main aim of this study was to assess if the perception of thermal pain thresholds is associated with genetically inferred levels of expression of the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT). Additionally, the perception of the so-called thermal grill illusion (TGI) was assessed. Forty-four healthy individuals (27 females, 17 males) were selected a-priori based on their 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 (‘tri-allelic 5-HTTLPR’) genotype, with inferred high or low 5-HTT expression. Thresholds for heat- and cold-pain were determined along with the sensory and affective dimensions of the TGI.



Results
Thresholds to heat- and cold-pain correlated strongly (rho  = −0.58, p<0.001). Individuals in the low 5-HTT-expressing group were significantly less sensitive to heat-pain (p = 0.02) and cold-pain (p = 0.03), compared to the high-expressing group. A significant gender-by-genotype interaction also emerged for cold-pain perception (p = 0.02); low 5-HTT-expressing females were less sensitive. The TGI was rated as significantly more unpleasant (affective-motivational dimension) than painful (sensory-discriminatory dimension), (p<0.001). Females in the low 5-HTT expressing group rated the TGI as significantly less unpleasant than high 5-HTT expressing females (p<0.05), with no such differences among men.



Conclusion/Significance
We demonstrate an association between inferred low 5-HTT expression and elevated thresholds to thermal pain in healthy non-depressed individuals. Despite the fact that reduced 5-HTT expression is a risk factor for chronic pain we found it to be related to hypoalgesia for threshold thermal pain. Low 5-HTT expression is, however, also a risk factor for depression where thermal insensitivity is often seen. Our results may thus contribute to a better understanding of the molecular underpinnings of such paradoxical hypoalgesia. The results point to a differential regulation of thermoafferent-information along the neuraxis on the basis of 5-HTT expression and gender. The TGI, suggested to rely on the central integration of thermoafferent-information, may prove a valuable tool in probing the affective-motivational dimension of these putative mechanisms.",16,"['was assessed', 'were selected', 'were determined', 'was rated', 'be related', 'is often seen']",6,6,0.375,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017752,Perception of Thermal Pain and the Thermal Grill Illusion Is Associated with Polymorphisms in the Serotonin Transporter Gene
"Abstract

Aim
The main aims of the study were to examine whether human neonates’ responses to communication disturbance modelled by the still-face paradigm were stable and whether their responses were affected by their previous experience with the still-face paradigm.



Methods
The still face procedure, as a laboratory model of interpersonal stress, was administered repeatedly, twice, to 84 neonates (0 to 4 day olds), with a delay of an average of 1.25 day.



Results
Frame-by-frame analysis of the frequency and duration of gaze, distressed face, crying, sleeping and sucking behaviours showed that the procedure was stressful to them both times, that is, the still face effect was stable after repeated administration and newborns consistently responded to such nonverbal violation of communication. They averted their gaze, showed distress and cried more during the still-face phase in both the first and the second administration. They also showed a carry-over effect in that they continued to avert their gaze and displayed increased distress and crying in the first reunion period, but their gaze behaviour changed with experience, in the second administration. While in the first administration the babies continued averting their gaze even after the stressful still-face phase was over, this carry-over effect disappeared in the second administration, and the babies significantly increased their gaze following the still-face phase.



Conclusion
After excluding explanations of fatigue, habituation and random effects, a self-other regulatory model is discussed as a possible explanation for this pattern.",7,"['were affected', 'was administered', 'is discussed']",3,3,0.42857142857142855,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181688,Neonates’ responses to repeated exposure to a still face

Aim
The present study aimed to investigate and compare parent-child agreement in different domains of child health and behavior.



Methods
Data were collected between 2011 and 2019 within the framework of the LIFE Child study (Germany). Different subgroups of 10- to 12-year-old children and their parents (n (max) = 692) completed questionnaires on several health behaviors (diet, media use, physical activity, sleep), parameters of health (behavioral strengths and difficulties, psychosomatic complaints), and school grades. Agreement between child and parent reports was evaluated using weighted kappa coefficients. Furthermore, the frequencies of different types of (dis)agreement (parent report > child report, same response, child report > parent report) were assessed and checked for associations with child or parent gender.



Results
Agreement between child and parent reports varied from low to almost perfect, with the greatest levels of agreement for school grades and organized physical activity, and the lowest for dizziness, sleep duration, and the consumption of potatoes. Child gender had no significant effect on parent-child agreement. In contrast, the findings suggest that parent gender had some effect on agreement levels, with higher agreement for certain psychosomatic complaints when parent reports were completed by the mother, and higher agreement for white bread consumption if they were completed by the father. For some of the questionnaire items (especially those relating to behavioral difficulties and psychosomatic complaints, but also to the consumption of individual food products and mobile phone use), the type of (dis)agreement differed depending on child or parent gender.



Conclusions
The findings suggest that the perceptions and reporting strategies of children and their parents can diverge considerably, in particular for behavior that is not easily observable or measurable.",10,"['were collected', 'was evaluated', 'were assessed and checked for', 'completed by the mother, and higher agreement for white bread consumption if they were completed by the father']",4,4,0.4,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0231462,Parent-child agreement in different domains of child behavior and health

Aim
The present study aims to develop the Race-related Attitudes and Multiculturalism Scale (RRAMS), as well as to perform an initial psychometric assessment of this instrument in a national sample of Australian adults.



Methods
The sample comprised 2,714 Australian adults who took part in the 2013 National Dental Telephone Interview Survey (NDTIS), which includes a telephone-based interview and a follow-up postal questionnaire. We used Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to evaluate the RRAMS’ factorial structure (n = 271) and then proceeded with Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to confirm the proposed structure in an independent sample (n = 2,443). Measurement invariance was evaluated according to sex, age and educational attainment. Construct validity was assessed through known-groups comparisons. Internal consistency was assessed with McDonald’s ΩH and ordinal α. Multiple imputation by chained equations was adopted to handle missing data.



Results
EFA indicated that, after excluding 4 out of the 12 items, a two-factor structure provided a good fit to the data. This configural structure was then confirmed in an independent sample by means of CFA (χ2(19) = 341.070, p<0.001, CFI = 0.974, RMSEA = 0.083; 90% CI [0.076, 0.091]). Measurement invariance analyses suggested that the RRAMS items can be used to compare men/women, respondents with/without tertiary education and young/older participants. The “Anglo-centric/Assimilationist attitudes” (ΩH = 0.83, αORDINAL = 0.85) and “Inclusive/Pluralistic attitudes” subscales (ΩH = 0.77, αORDINAL = 0.79) showed adequate reliability. Men and participants with low education had higher Anglo-centric/assimilationist attitudes and lower inclusive/pluralistic attitudes, suggesting construct validity.



Conclusions
The RRAMS appears to be a valid and reliable measure to evaluate multiculturalist attitudes in the Australian context. The instrument may be useful in the assessment and monitoring of interventions aiming to promote multiculturalist inclusive attitudes and to increase social cohesion in Australia.",13,"['was evaluated', 'was assessed', 'was assessed', 'was adopted', 'was then confirmed', 'can be used']",6,5,0.38461538461538464,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230724,Development and initial psychometric assessment of the race-related attitudes and multiculturalism scale in Australia

Aim
The present study attempted to test McCullough and Willoughby’s hypothesis that self-control mediates the relationships between religiosity and psychosocial outcomes. Specifically, this study examined whether trait self-control (TSC) mediates the relationship of identified-introjected religiosity with positive and negative health-related-feelings (HRF) in healthy Muslims.



Methods
Two hundred eleven French-speaking participants (116 females, 95 males; Mage = 28.15, SDage = 6.90) answered questionnaires. One hundred ninety participants were retained for the analyses because they reported to be healthy (105 females, 85 males; Mage = 27.72, SDage = 6.80). To examine the relationships between religiosity, TSC and HRF, two competing mediation models were tested using structural equation model analysis: While a starting model used TSC as mediator of the religiosity-HRF relationship, an alternative model used religiosity as mediator of the TSC-HRF relationship.



Results
The findings revealed that TSC mediated the relationship between identified religiosity and positive HRF, and that identified religiosity mediated the relationship between TSC and positive and negative HRF, thereby validating both models. Moreover, the comparison of both models showed that the starting model explained 13.211% of the variance (goodness of fit = 1.000), whereas the alternative model explained 6.877% of the variance (goodness of fit = 0.987).



Conclusion
These results show that the starting model is the most effective model to account for the relationships between religiosity, TSC, and HRF. Therefore, this study provides initial insights into how religiosity influences psychological health through TSC. Important practical implications for the religious education are suggested.",10,"['were retained', 'were tested', 'are suggested']",3,3,0.3,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0126193,"Trait Self-Control, Identified-Introjected Religiosity and Health-Related-Feelings in Healthy Muslims: A Structural Equation Model Analysis"

Aim
The present study employed Experience Sampling Methodology to examine whether the interaction between childhood bullying and FKBP5 variability (i) is associated with the expression of psychotic-like experiences, paranoia, and negative affect, and (ii) moderates psychotic-like, paranoid, and affective reactivity to different forms of momentary stress (situational and social) in daily life.



Methods
A total of 206 nonclinical young adults were interviewed for bullying with the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse and were prompted randomly eight times daily for one week to complete assessments of their current experiences, affect, and stress appraisals. Participants were genotyped for three FKBP5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs3800373, rs9296158, and rs1360780) that have been linked to hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity. Multilevel analyses were conducted to examine the effect of the interaction between childhood bullying and the FKBP5 haplotype derived from these three SNPs.



Results
The interaction between bullying and the FKBP5 haplotype was associated with positive, but not negative, psychotic-like experiences, paranoia, and negative affect. The bullying x FKBP5 interaction also moderated the association of a social stress appraisal (specifically, being alone because people do not want to be with you) with psychotic-like experiences and negative affect in daily life. Simple slopes analyses indicated that, in all cases, the associations were significantly increased by exposure to bullying in participants with the risk haplotype, but not for those with the non-risk haplotype.



Discussion
The present study provides the first evidence of the interplay between childhood bullying and FKBP5 variability in the real-world expression of psychosis proneness and social stress reactivity. The findings underscore the importance of investigating how gene-environment interactions are involved in mechanistic pathways to the extended psychosis phenotype and lend further support to the increasing relevance given to socially defeating appraisals in the experience of reality distortion.",9,"['were interviewed', 'were prompted', 'were genotyped', 'have been linked', 'were conducted', 'were significantly increased']",6,4,0.4444444444444444,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158809,The Interaction between Childhood Bullying and the FKBP5 Gene on Psychotic-Like Experiences and Stress Reactivity in Real Life

Aim
The present study evaluated the relation between speech perception in the presence of background noise and temporal processing ability in listeners with Auditory Neuropathy (AN).



Method
The study included two experiments. In the first experiment, temporal resolution of listeners with normal hearing and those with AN was evaluated using measures of temporal modulation transfer function and frequency modulation detection at modulation rates of 2 and 10 Hz. In the second experiment, speech perception in quiet and noise was evaluated at three signal to noise ratios (SNR) (0, 5, and 10 dB).



Results
Results demonstrated that listeners with AN performed significantly poorer than normal hearing listeners in both amplitude modulation and frequency modulation detection, indicating significant impairment in extracting envelope as well as fine structure cues from the signal. Furthermore, there was significant correlation seen between measures of temporal resolution and speech perception in noise.



Conclusion
Results suggested that an impaired ability to efficiently process envelope and fine structure cues of the speech signal may be the cause of the extreme difficulties faced during speech perception in noise by listeners with AN.",7,"['was evaluated', 'was evaluated', 'correlation seen']",3,3,0.42857142857142855,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055995,Temporal Processing and Speech Perception in Noise by Listeners with Auditory Neuropathy

Aim
The present study utilizes perceptual hysteresis effects to compare the ambiguity of Mona Lisa’s emotional face expression (high-level ambiguity) and of geometric cube stimuli (low-level ambiguity).



Methods
In two experiments we presented series of nine Mona Lisa variants and nine cube variants. Stimulus ambiguity was manipulated by changing Mona Lisa’s mouth curvature (Exp. 1) and the cubes’ back-layer luminance (Exp. 2). Each experiment consisted of three conditions, two with opposite stimulus presentation sequences with increasing and decreasing degrees of ambiguity, respectively, and a third condition with a random presentation sequence. Participants indicated happy or sad face percepts (Exp. 1) and alternative 3D cube percepts (Exp. 2) by key presses. We studied the influences of a priori perceptual biases (long-term memory) and presentation order (short-term memory) on perception.



Results
Perception followed sigmoidal functions of the stimulus ambiguity morphing parameters. The morphing parameter for the functions’ inflection points depended strongly on stimulus presentation order with similar effect sizes but different signs for the two stimulus types (positive hysteresis / priming for the cubes; negative hysteresis / adaptation for Mona Lisa). In the random conditions, the inflection points were located in the middle between those from the two directional conditions for the Mona Lisa stimuli. For the cube stimuli, they were superimposed on one sigmoidal function for the ordered condition.



Discussion
The hysteresis effects reflect the influence of short-term memory during the perceptual disambiguation of ambiguous sensory information. The effects for the two stimulus types are of similar size, explaining up to 34% of the perceptual variance introduced by the paradigm. We explain the qualitative difference between positive and negative hysteresis with adaptation for Mona Lisa and with priming for the cubes. In addition, the hysteresis paradigm allows a quantitative determination of the impact of adaptation and priming during the resolution of perceptual ambiguities. The asymmetric shifts of inflection points in the case of the cube stimuli is likely due to an a priori perceptual bias, reflecting an influence of long-term memory. Whether corresponding influences also exist for the Mona Lisa variants is so far unclear.",16,"['was manipulated', 'were located', 'were superimposed']",3,3,0.1875,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202398,Positive and negative hysteresis effects for the perception of geometric and emotional ambiguities

Aim
The primary aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) and Neuro-Sensory Motor Developmental Assessment (NSMDA) over the first year of life for predicting motor impairment at 4 years in preterm children. The secondary aims were to assess the predictive value of serial assessments over the first year and when using a combination of these two assessment tools in follow-up.



Method
Children born <30 weeks’ gestation were prospectively recruited and assessed at 4, 8 and 12 months’ corrected age using the AIMS and NSMDA. At 4 years’ corrected age children were assessed for cerebral palsy (CP) and motor impairment using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children 2nd-edition (MABC-2). We calculated accuracy of the AIMS and NSMDA for predicting CP and MABC-2 scores ≤15th (at-risk of motor difficulty) and ≤5th centile (significant motor difficulty) for each test (AIMS and NSMDA) at 4, 8 and 12 months, for delay on one, two or all three of the time points over the first year, and finally for delay on both tests at each time point.



Results
Accuracy for predicting motor impairment was good for each test at each age, although false positives were common. Motor impairment on the MABC-2 (scores ≤5th and ≤15th) was most accurately predicted by the AIMS at 4 months, whereas CP was most accurately predicted by the NSMDA at 12 months. In regards to serial assessments, the likelihood ratio for motor impairment increased with the number of delayed assessments. When combining both the NSMDA and AIMS the best accuracy was achieved at 4 months, although results were similar at 8 and 12 months.



Interpretation
Motor development during the first year of life in preterm infants assessed with the AIMS and NSMDA is predictive of later motor impairment at preschool age. However, false positives are common and therefore it is beneficial to follow-up children at high risk of motor impairment at more than one time point, or to use a combination of assessment tools.

Aim
The purpose of the study was to determine anxiety and depression, quality of life, and their determinants in long-term survivors of malignant melanoma.



Methods
In a state cancer registry a cohort of survivors of malignant melanoma was contacted via the physician registered. Of 1302 contactable patients, 689 (52.2%) completed a questionnaire including the Patient Health Questionnaire with generalized anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9) and the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ 30). Based on multiple regression analysis, predictors of quality of life and distress were identified. Comparison data were assessed in two waves of representative face-to-face household surveys of the adult German population.



Results
An average of 8.4 (5.7 to 12.2) years after diagnosis, distress was higher in women compared to men and in middle adulthood (vs. older patients). Symptoms were higher in women than in men, and there was a decline of functioning and increase of symptoms across the age range of both genders. Compared to the general population, there were slightly increased depression and anxiety (only women), but no impaired global quality of life. Yet, survivors evidenced functional decline and more physical symptoms. Distress and reduced quality of life were consistently predicted by lack of social support, fear of recurrence, pessimism and self-blame. Distress was increased by a family history of melanoma, and additional mental and somatic diseases.



Conclusion
Overall, long-term survivors have adjusted well achieving a global quality of life comparable to the general population. Yet, compromised functional dimensions, physical symptoms and distress indicate the need for integrating psychooncological screening into oncological follow-up, which might be guided by predictors such as family history or social support. Further prospective study is needed to determine the course of adaptation to the disease and corroborate the risk factors identified.",13,"['was contacted', 'were identified', 'were assessed', 'were consistently predicted', 'was increased', 'might be guided', 'is needed']",7,7,0.5384615384615384,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0116440,"Depression, Anxiety and Quality of Life in Long-Term Survivors of Malignant Melanoma: A Register-Based Cohort Study"

We recruited 329 obese subjects: 203 female (BMI 43,74 kg/m2 ± 0.5 SE; age 17–83 years, 58.33 ± 0.9 SE) and 126 male (BMI 44,27kg/m2 ± 0.7 DE age 27–79 years, 58.84 ± 1 SE). To assess dizziness we used the validated Italian version (38) of the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI).

Out of the experimental sample, 100 subjects did not complain of dizziness and felt confident about their balance control, while 69.6% reported some degree of dizziness. Their mean DHI score was 22.3, which corresponds to mild dizziness. Twenty-one percent reported more severe dizziness (DHI score > 40). The majority of our sample reported minor dizziness and its perception appears to be independent from BMI: DHI scores were consistent across classes of obesity.



Discussion
The rate of dizziness and falls (30.1%) in an this obese population was higher than that previously reported in a general matched population. However, obese subjects, in our sample, seem to underestimate their risk of fall and DHI score does not appear a reliable predictor of falls. Since complications associated with falls in obese persons generally require longer treatments than in lean individuals, our findings should be taken into account in order to identify other predictors, including cognitive and perceptual, of risk of fall and to implement fall prevention programs.",11,['should be taken'],1,1,0.09090909090909091,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169322,Dizziness and Falls in Obese Inpatients Undergoing Metabolic Rehabilitation
"Abstract

Aim
The terms used to describe care at the end of life (EoL), and its definitions, have evolved over time and reflect the changes in meaning the concept has undergone as the field develops. We explore the remit of EoL care as defined by experts in EoL care, from across Europe and beyond, to understand its current usage and meanings.



Method
A qualitative survey attached to a call for expertise on cultural issues in EoL care was sent to experts in the field identified through the literature, European EoL care associations, and conferences targeted at EoL care professionals. Respondents were asked to identify further contacts for snowball recruitment.The responses were analysed using content and discourse analysis.



Results
Responses were received from 167 individuals (33% response rate), mainly from academics (39%) and clinical practitioners working in an academic context (23%) from 19 countries in Europe and beyond. 29% of respondents said explicitly that there was no agreed definition of EoL care in practice and only 14% offered a standard definition (WHO, or local institution). 2% said that the concept of EoL care was not used in their country, and 5% said that there was opposition to the concept for religious or cultural reasons. Two approaches were identified to arrive at an understanding of EoL care: exclusively by drawing boundaries through setting time frames, and inclusively by approaching its scope in an integrative way. This led to reflections about terminology and whether defining EoL care is desirable.



Conclusion
The global expansion of EoL care contributes to the variety of interpretations of what it means. This complicates the endeavour of defining the field. However, when diversity is taken seriously it can open up new perspectives to underpin the ethical framework of EoL care.",12,"['defined by experts in eol care, from across europe', 'survey attached', 'was sent', 'were asked', 'were analysed', 'were received', 'was not used', 'were identified', 'is taken']",9,7,0.5833333333333334,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0068002,Diversity in Defining End of Life Care: An Obstacle or the Way Forward?
"Abstract

Aim
There are substantial differences in the amount of research concerned with different disorders. This paper considers why.



Methods
Bibliographic searches were conducted to identify publications (1985–2009) concerned with 35 neurodevelopmental disorders: Developmental dyslexia, Developmental dyscalculia, Developmental coordination disorder, Speech sound disorder, Specific language impairment, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Autistic spectrum disorder, Tourette syndrome, Intellectual disability, Angelman syndrome, Cerebral palsy, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Cri du chat syndrome, Down syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Fetal alcohol syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Galactosaemia, Klinefelter syndrome, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Lowe syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome, Phenylketonuria, Prader-Willi syndrome, Rett syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, Trisomy 18, Tuberous sclerosis, Turner syndrome, Velocardiofacial syndrome, Williams syndrome, XXX and XYY. A publication index reflecting N publications relative to prevalence was derived.



Results
The publication index was higher for rare than common conditions. However, this was partly explained by the tendency for rare disorders to be more severe.



Interpretation
Although research activity is predictable from severity and prevalence, there are exceptions. Low rates of research, and relatively low levels of NIH funding, characterise conditions that are the domain of a single discipline with limited research resources. Growth in research is not explained by severity, and was exceptionally steep for autism and ADHD.",10,"['were conducted', 'was derived', 'was partly explained', 'is not explained']",4,4,0.4,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0015112,Which Neurodevelopmental Disorders Get Researched and Why?
"Abstract

Aim
This research compared real-time measurements of alcohol consumption with retrospective accounts of alcohol consumption to examine possible discrepancies between, and contextual influences on, the different accounts.



Method
Building on previous investigations, a specifically designed Smartphone technology was utilized to measure alcohol consumption and contextual influences in de facto real-time. Real-time data (a total of 10,560 data points relating to type and number of drinks and current social / environmental context) were compared with daily and weekly retrospective accounts of alcohol consumption.



Results
Participants reported consuming more alcoholic drinks during real-time assessment than retrospectively. For daily accounts a higher number of drinks consumed in real-time was related to a higher discrepancy between real-time and retrospective accounts. This effect was found across all drink types but was not shaped by social and environmental contexts. Higher in-vivo alcohol consumption appeared to be related to a higher discrepancy in retrospectively reported weekly consumption for alcohol beverage types other than wine. When including contextual factors into the statistical models, being with two or more friends (as opposed to being alone) decreased the discrepancy between real-time and retrospective reports, whilst being in the pub (relative to being at home) was associated with greater discrepancies.



Conclusions
Overall, retrospective accounts may underestimate the amount of actual, real-time alcohol consumed. Increased consumption may also exacerbate differences between real-time and retrospective accounts. Nonetheless, this is not a global effect as environmental and social contexts interact with the type of alcohol consumed and the time frame given for reporting (weekly vs. daily retrospective). A degree of caution therefore appears warranted with regards to the use of retrospective self-report methods of recording alcohol consumption. Whilst real-time sampling is unlikely to be completely error free, it may be better able to account for social and environmental influences on self-reported consumption.",13,"['was utilized', 'were compared', 'was related', 'was found', 'was not shaped', 'be related']",6,5,0.38461538461538464,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0126209,“I Have No Clue What I Drunk Last Night” Using Smartphone Technology to Compare In-Vivo and Retrospective Self-Reports of Alcohol Consumption
"Abstract

Aim
This study aimed to develop a “family caregiver needs-assessment scale for end-of-life care for senility at home” (FADE) and examine its reliability and validity.



Method
A draft item pool was developed based on a literature review, and simplified to 30 items in four domains. Next, the item pool was reviewed by four visiting nurses and four researchers and refined to 15 items. A cross-sectional study was then conducted using a self-reported questionnaire. Questionnaires were sent to 2703 visiting nurses. The survey questions included participants’ basic demographic information, the importance of each item according to a modified scale, basic demographics for cases of death by senility at home, satisfaction with each item of the modified scale in an example case, and assessment of the case using the Japanese version of the Support Team Assessment Schedule (STAS-J). Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. Construct validity was confirmed using confirmatory factor analysis, and correlation between the new scale and the STAS-J was used to assess criterion-related validity.



Results
In total, 461 visiting nurses provided valid responses. The exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses identified 12 items from two factors: “Needs for adaptation to senility bereavement” and “Needs for essential skills in supporting a dignified death by senility.” The final model showed appropriate index values: standardized root mean residual = 0.057, Tucker–Lewis index = 0.920, Akaike information criterion = 191.6, and Bayesian information criterion = 298.2. Cronbach’s alpha for the entire scale was 0.908, and was above 0.840 for each factor. The correlation coefficient between STAS-J and the entire scale was 0.259–0.427 (p<0.001).



Conclusions
The FADE scale showed acceptable internal consistency and concurrent validity. The scale can help clarify issues and desires that present themselves at home related to adaptation to senility bereavement and essential skills in supporting a dignified death by senility. Addressing these issues and desires is expected to reduce caregivers’ anxiety and burden, and means the older adults under their care may be respected and enabled to live with dignity and peace.",15,"['was developed', 'was reviewed', 'was then conducted', 'were sent', 'was assessed', 'was confirmed', 'was used', 'is expected', 'may be respected']",9,7,0.4666666666666667,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0222235,Development of a family caregiver needs-assessment scale for end-of-life care for senility at home (FADE)
"Abstract

Aim
This study aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of the Structured Observation of Motor Performance in Infants (SOMP-I) when used by nurses in routine child healthcare by analyzing the nurses’ SOMP-I assessments and the actions taken when motor problems were suspected.



Method
Infants from three child health centers in Uppsala County, Sweden, were consecutively enrolled in a longitudinal study. The 242 infants were assessed using SOMP-I by the nurse responsible for the infant as part of the regular well-child visits at as close to 2, 4, 6 and 10 months of age as possible. The nurses noted actions taken such as giving advice, scheduling an extra follow-up or referring the infant to specialized care. The infants’ motor development was reassessed at 18 months of age through review of medical records or parental report.



Results
The assessments of level of motor development at 2 and 10 months showed a distribution corresponding to the percentile distribution of the SOMP-I method. Fewer infants than expected were assessed as delayed at 4 and 6 months or deficient in quality at all assessment ages. When an infant was assessed as delayed in level or deficient in quality, the likelihood of the nurse taking actions increased. This increased further if both delay and quality deficit were found at the same assessment or if one or both were found at repeated assessments. The reassessment of the motor development at 18 months did not reveal any missed infants with major motor impairments.



Interpretation
The use of SOMP-I appears to demonstrate favorable clinical utility in routine child healthcare as tested here. Child health nurses can assess early motor performance using this standardized assessment method, and using the method appears to support them the clinical decision-making.",12,"['used by nurses in routine child healthcare', 'were suspected', 'were consecutively enrolled', 'were assessed', 'was reassessed', 'were assessed', 'was assessed', 'were found', 'were found']",9,7,0.5833333333333334,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181398,Clinical utility of the Structured Observation of Motor Performance in Infants within the child health services
"Abstract

Aim
This study aims at investigating the nomological validity of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ II) by using an extension of the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model with aspects of work ability as outcome.



Material and methods
The study design is cross-sectional. All staff working at public dental organizations in four regions of Sweden were invited to complete an electronic questionnaire (75% response rate, n = 1345). The questionnaire was based on COPSOQ II scales, the Utrecht Work Engagement scale, and the one-item Work Ability Score in combination with a proprietary item. The data was analysed by Structural Equation Modelling.



Results
This study contributed to the literature by showing that: A) The scale characteristics were satisfactory and the construct validity of COPSOQ instrument could be integrated in the JD-R framework; B) Job resources arising from leadership may be a driver of the two processes included in the JD-R model; and C) Both the health impairment and motivational processes were associated with WA, and the results suggested that leadership may impact WA, in particularly by securing task resources.



Conclusion
In conclusion, the nomological validity of COPSOQ was supported as the JD-R model-can be operationalized by the instrument. This may be helpful for transferral of complex survey results and work life theories to practitioners in the field.",8,"['were invited', 'was analysed', 'could be integrated', 'was supported', 'can be operationalized']",5,4,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196450,Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire - A validation study using the Job Demand-Resources model

Aim
This study examined the predictors of loss to follow-up in long-term supportive periodontal therapy in patients with chronic periodontitis.



Methods
A total of 280 patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis in a tertiary care hospital in China were investigated and followed over the course of study. Questionnaires on clinical and demographic characteristics, self-efficacy for oral self-care and dental fear at baseline were completed. Participants were followed to determine whether they could adhere to long-term supportive periodontal therapy. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between clinical and demographic characteristics, self-efficacy for oral self-care, dental fear and loss to follow-up in long-term supportive periodontal therapy.



Results
The loss to follow-up in long-term supportive periodontal therapy was significantly associated with age [adjusted OR = 1.042, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.012–1.074, p = 0.006], severe periodontitis [adjusted OR = 4.892, 95%CI: 2.280–10.499, p<0.001], periodontal surgery [adjusted OR = 11.334, 95% CI: 2.235–57.472, p = 0.003], and middle and low-scoring of self-efficacy scale for self-care groups. The adjusted ORs of loss to follow-up for the middle- (54–59) and low-scoring groups (15–53) were 71.899 (95%CI: 23.926–216.062, p<0.001) and 4.800 (95% CI: 2.263–10.182, p<0.001), respectively, compared with the high-scoring SESS group (60–75).



Conclusion
Age, severity of periodontitis, periodontal surgery and the level of self-efficacy for self-care may be effective predictors of loss to follow-up in long-term supportive periodontal therapy in patients with chronic periodontitis.",8,"['were investigated and followed over', 'were completed', 'were followed', 'was used']",4,4,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192221,Prediction of loss to follow-up in long-term supportive periodontal therapy in patients with chronic periodontitis
"Abstract

Aim
This study set out to investigate whether cognitive coping strategies that match participants’ preferred coping style effectively reduce pain intensity and situational anxiety in a population of people with chronic pain.



Method
Chronic pain patients (N = 43) completed questionnaires on coping style, pain intensity, self-efficacy, and situational/trait anxiety. Participants were classified as Monitors (n = 16) or Blunters (n = 19) based on their Miller Behavioural Style Scale score. Participants were then provided with an audiotaped intervention in which they were instructed to focus on pain sensations or to engage in a distraction task and then to rate the pain intensity and their anxiety during and after the attentional focus and distraction conditions. The two interventions were each completed by all participants, having been presented in counterbalanced order.



Results
Findings revealed that Monitors’ level of anxiety decreased following a congruent (i.e., sensation-focused) intervention. No effects were obtained in terms of perceived pain. For blunters, however, their perceived levels of anxiety and pain did not attenuate following a congruent, distraction-focused intervention.



Conclusion
Among persons experiencing chronic pain, tailoring coping strategies to match an individual’s preferred coping style–in particular, those with a high level of monitoring–may enhance the benefit of psychological approaches to management of anxiety.",9,"['were classified', 'were then provided', 'were instructed', 'having been presented', 'were obtained']",5,4,0.4444444444444444,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0142285,Cognitive Coping Style and the Effectiveness of Distraction or Sensation-Focused Instructions in Chronic Pain Patients
"Abstract

Aim
To assess the concurrent validity and discriminative ability of total, gross and fine motor (TM, GM and FM) scores of Dutch performance-based motor tests, the Baecke-Fassaert Motor Test (BFMT) and the 8- and 4-Skills Scan (SkSc) with the Movement Assessment Battery (MABC) for children at age 5.



Method
116 Dutch children (40.3% boys) were included. Spearman’s rho correlations and area under the curves (AUC) were assessed.



Results
Correlations between the TM scores of the tests were strong (absolute values from 0.58 to .65); the correlations between the GM scores and the FM scores between and within tests were weaker (absolute values from 0.30 to 0.45). Related to the cut-off (15th percentile) of the MABC, the AUC of the BFMT, 8- and 4-SkSc, the AUC was 0.853 (95% CI: 0.757–0.949), 0.905 (95% CI: 0.837–0.972) and 0.844 (95% CI: 0.730–0.957), respectively. At optimal cut-offs, the sensitivity and specificity of the BFMT, the 8- and 4-SkSc were 78.6 and 78.4%, 92.2 and 73.2%, 78.6 and 76.3%, respectively.



Conclusion
All tests had a reasonably high discriminative ability, but validation with the MABC-2 and adaptations are needed to meet the requirements for screening (i.e. sensitivity ≥80% and specificity ≥90%). The relatively weak correlation between GM and FM scores implies that tests should be normalized and validated for GM and FM ability, separately.",9,"['were included', 'were assessed', 'are needed', 'should be normalized']",4,4,0.4444444444444444,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0224722,Concurrent validity and discriminative ability of Dutch performance-based motor tests in 5 to 6 years old children

Aim
To assess the effects of differential exposure to antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) on short- and long-term outcomes of infants born before 24 weeks of gestation.



Methods
This is a retrospective cohort study of 147 infants delivered by 116 women at 21–23 weeks of gestation between January 2001 and December 2016 at a tertiary referral hospital in Seoul, Korea. Eligible subjects were categorized into the following three groups according to ACS exposure: non-user (n = 53), partial-course (n = 44), and complete-course (n = 50). Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to compare neonatal mortality, neonatal morbidities including intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and neurodevelopmental impairment including cerebral palsy among the three groups.



Results
Neonatal mortality rate was significantly lower in the ACS-user groups (non-user, 52.8%; partial-course, 27.3%; complete-course, 28.0%; P = 0.01), but complete-course of ACS therapy had no advantages over partial-course. A lower incidence of IVH was observed in the complete-course group (non-users, 54.8%; partial-course, 48.6%; complete-course, 20.5%; P = 0.003). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that ACS therapy, either partial- or complete-course, was associated with a lower rate of neonatal mortality (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.375; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.141–0.996 in partial-course; aOR 0.173; 95% CI 0.052–0.574) in complete-course). IVH (aOR 0.191; 95% CI 0.071–0.516) was less likely to occur in the complete-course group than in the non-user group. Neurodevelopmental impairment of survivors at 18–22 month after birth was not significantly different among the three groups.



Conclusion
ACS therapy in preterm births at 21–23 weeks of gestation was associated with significantly reduced rates of neonatal mortality and IVH, especially with complete administration.",10,"['were categorized', 'were used', 'was observed']",3,3,0.3,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198471,Short- and long-term neonatal outcomes according to differential exposure to antenatal corticosteroid therapy in preterm births prior to 24 weeks of gestation

Aim
To assess the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and mental health of adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP) in rural Bangladesh.



Methods
Case-control study of adolescents with CP (10 to ≤18-years) and age and sex matched controls without disability. Primary caregivers were included for proxy report. HRQoL was measured with Bengali versions CP Quality of Life-Teens (CPQoL-Teens) and KIDSCREEN-27. Mental health was measured with Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).



Results
154 cases and 173 controls matched on age and sex participated (mean age 15.1 (1.6) and 14.9 (1.6) respectively; female n = 48, n = 55 respectively, p>0.05). CPQoL-Teens was administered to adolescents with CP only; mean outcomes ranged from 38.5 (27.4) to 71.5 (16.1) and ‘feelings about functioning’ was poorest domain for both self- and proxy-report groups. KIDSCREEN-27 was administered to adolescents with CP and controls; adolescents with CP mean outcomes ranged from 25.9 (12.2) to 48.7 (10.56) and were significantly poorer than controls, mean difference 4.3 (95% CI 0.7 to 7.8) to 16.7 (95% CI 14.5 to 18.5), p<0.05. ‘Peers and social support’ was poorest domain for all groups. In regards to mental health, adolescents with CP reported significantly poorer mean SDQ than peers without disability, mean difference 0.7 (95% CI 0.3 to 1.1) to 7.8 (95% CI 6.7 to 8.9), p<0.05; and were for self-report 7.8 (95% CI 2.6 to 23.0) and proxy-report 12.0 (95% CI 6.9 to 20.9) times more likely to report ‘probable’ range ‘total difficulties’ score. Individual item analysis of CPQoL-Teens and KIDSCREEN-27 identified unique areas of concern for adolescents with CP related to pain, friendships, physical activity and energy, what may happen later in life, and feelings about having CP. Financial resources were of concern for both cases and controls.



Interpretation
Adolescents with CP in rural Bangladesh are at high risk of poor HRQoL and mental health problems. Effort to reduce the disparity between adolescents with CP and those without disability should consider wellbeing holistically and target dimensions including physical, psychological and social wellbeing. Specific interventions to alleviate modifiable aspects of HRQoL including pain, social isolation, and physical in-activity are recommended.",15,"['were included', 'was measured', 'was measured', 'was administered', 'was administered', 'are recommended']",6,6,0.4,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217675,Health-related quality of life and mental health of adolescents with cerebral palsy in rural Bangladesh

Aim
To assess the potential relationship between intelligence structure abnormalities and whole-brain functional connectivity in children with primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to provide insights into the association between these two seemingly unrelated conditions.



Methods
Intelligence testing and fMRI data were obtained from 133 right-handed children, including 67 PNE children (M/F, 39∶28; age, 10.5±1.2 y) and 66 age-matched healthy controls (M/F, 37∶29; age, 10.1±1.1 y). All intelligence tests were performed using the China-Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (C-WISC). Each subject’s full intelligence quotient (FIQ), verbal IQ (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ), and memory/caution (M/C) factor was measured and recorded. Resting state fMRI scans were performed on a 3.0-T MR scanner and post-processed using REST software. Comparisons of z-score correlation coefficients between distinct cerebral regions were used to identify altered functional connectivity in PNE children.



Results
The PNE group had normal FIQ, VIQ, and PIQ values, indicating no significant variation from the control group. However, the M/C factor was significantly lower in the PNE group. Compared to the control group, PNE children exhibited overall lower levels of functional connectivity that were most apparent in the cerebello-thalamo-frontal pathway. The M/C factor significantly correlated with z-scores representing connectivity between Cerebellum_Crus1_L and Frontal_Mid_R.



Conclusion
PNE children exhibit intelligence structure imbalance and attention deficits. Our findings suggest that cerebello-thalamo-frontal circuit abnormalities are likely to be involved in the onset and progression of attention impairment in PNE children.",12,"['were obtained', 'were performed', 'was measured and recorded.', 'were performed', 'were used']",5,5,0.4166666666666667,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0051924,Aberrant Whole-Brain Functional Connectivity and Intelligence Structure in Children with Primary Nocturnal Enuresis
"Abstract

Aim
To assess the prevalence of self-reported dental pain and its association with sociodemographic, clinical and behavioral/psychosocial indicators among 8- to 10-year-old Brazilian schoolchildren.



Design
A cross-sectional study was carried out with 1,589 eight- to ten-year-old children randomly selected from public schools of Florianopolis, Brazil. Self-reports of dental pain were collected through a single question as follows: “In the last month, how many times have you had pain in your teeth?” Caries experience was determined by the DMFT/dmft index and its clinical consequences by the PUFA/pufa index. Dental trauma, dental fluorosis and molar-incisor hypomineralization were assessed through the Andreasen, Dean and European Academy of Pediatric Dentistry classifications, respectively. Clinical signs of dental erosion were also observed. Sociodemographic indicators were obtained through a questionnaire answered by the children’s caregivers. Information about behavioral/psychosocial indicators was collected through questions from the Brazilian version of the Child Perception Questionnaire 8–10 years (CPQ8–10). Descriptive analysis, chi-square test, and hierarchically adjusted Poisson regression models were performed.



Results
819 children (51.5%) reported episodes of dental pain in the last month prior to the study, whereas 55.6% (n = 509) were girls. The presence of dental pain was significantly associated with sex, trouble sleeping, difficulty eating, school absenteeism, difficulty with paying attention in class, difficulty doing homework, staying away from recreational activities, caries experience, PUFA/pufa index and ulceration (p<0.05).



Conclusion
The prevalence of self-reported dental pain in 8- to 10- year-old Brazilian schoolchildren was high and was associated with sociodemographic, clinical and behavioral/psychosocial indicators.",12,"['was carried', 'were collected', 'was determined', 'were assessed', 'were also observed', 'were obtained', 'was collected', 'were performed']",8,8,0.6666666666666666,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0214990,Prevalence of self-reported dental pain and associated factors among eight- to ten-year-old Brazilian schoolchildren
"Abstract

Aim
To compare the outcomes of finger reconstruction using arterialized venous flap (AVF), superficial palmar branch of the radial artery (SPBRA) flap, posterior interosseous perforator flap (PIPF), and ulnar artery perforator free (UAPF) flap harvested from the ipsilateral extremity.



Methods
We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes for 41 free flaps from the ipsilateral extremity in the reconstruction of finger defects in 41 patients with small/moderate skin defects, including 11 AVFs, 10 SPBRA flaps, 10 PIPFs, and 10 UAPF flaps. Standardized assessment of outcomes was performed, including duration of operation, objective sensory recovery, cold intolerance, time of returning to work, active total range of motion (ROM) of the injured fingers, and the cosmetic appearance of the donor/recipient sites.



Results
All flaps survived completely, and the follow-up duration was 13.5 months. The mean duration of the complete surgical procedure for AVFs was distinctly shorter than that of the other flaps (p<0.05). AVFs were employed to reconstruct skin defects and extensor tendon defects using a vascularized palmaris longus graft in 4 fingers. Digital blood supply was reestablished in 4 fingers by flow-through technique when using AVFs. Optimal sensory recovery was better with AVFs and SPBRA flaps as compared with UAPF flaps and PIPFs (p<0.05). No significant differences were noted in ROM or cold intolerance between the 4 groups. Optimal cosmetic satisfaction was noted for the recipient sites of AVFs and the donor sites of SPBRA flaps. The number of second-stage defatting operations required for AVFs was considerably lesser than that for the other flaps.



Conclusion
All 4 types of free flaps from the ipsilateral extremity are a practical choice in finger reconstruction for small/moderate-sized skin defects. AVFs play an important role in such operations due to the wider indications, and better sensory recovery and cosmetic appearance associated with this method.",13,"['was performed', 'were employed', 'was reestablished', 'were noted', 'was noted']",5,5,0.38461538461538464,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0104014,A Comparative Study of Four Types of Free Flaps from the Ipsilateral Extremity for Finger Reconstruction
"Abstract

Aim
To conduct a meta-ethnographic study of the experiences, meanings and ways of ‘dealing with’ symptoms or a diagnosis of postnatal depression amongst migrant women living in high income countries.



Background
Prevalence of postnatal depression is highest amongst women who are migrants. Yet many women do not seek help for their symptoms and health services do not always respond appropriately to migrant women’s needs. Studies have reported migrant women’s experiences of postnatal depression and it is timely to synthesise findings from these studies to understand how services can be improved.



Design
A meta-ethnographic synthesis of 12 studies reported in 15 papers



Data sources
Five databases were searched for papers published between January 1999 and February 2016



Review methods
The quality of included studies was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program tool. The synthesis process was guided by the seven steps of meta-ethnography outlined by Noblit and Hare.



Findings
Four key metaphors were identified: “I am alone, worried and angry—this is not me!”; ‘Making sense of my feelings’ ‘Dealing with my feelings’ and ‘What I need to change the way I feel!’. Primarily women related their feelings to their position as a migrant and as women, often living in poor socio-economic circumstances and they were exhausted keeping up with expected commitments. Many women were resourceful, drawing on their personal strengths and family / community resources. All the studies reported that women experienced difficulties in accessing appropriate services.



Conclusion
The meta-ethnographic study demonstrates the impact of migration on perinatal mental health, particularly for women lacking family support, who have no employment, a precarious migration status and/or relationship conflict. Migrant women are resourceful and this requires support through appropriate services. Further research is needed to evaluate effective support strategies for migrant women in the perinatal period.",13,"['can be improved', 'were searched', 'was assessed', 'was guided', 'were identified', 'is needed']",6,5,0.38461538461538464,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172385,"Migrant women’s experiences, meanings and ways of dealing with postnatal depression: A meta-ethnographic study"
"Abstract

Aim
To determine if there is an association between sarcopenia, physical function and self-reported fatigue in osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).



Methods
A cross-sectional analysis of measurements from a cohort of 157 participants with OA or RA was performed. The relationship between muscle mass (appendicular muscle index (AMI)), physical function (timed up and go, 30-seconds sit-to-stand test, 40-meter fast-paced walk test and grip-strength) and two fatigue measures (Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF) and a fatigue Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)) was explored using hierarchical linear regression or logistic regression with established AMI cut-offs for sarcopenia.



Results
There were no significant differences for perceived fatigue-related variables between OA or RA sarcopenic or non-sarcopenic participants. Participants with OA had worse physical function (TUG; P = 0.029, STS; P = 0.004, WS; P = 0.003), but participants with RA had lower grip strength (P<0.001). The RA group had higher CRP (P = 0.006), were more likely to receive glucocorticoids (P<0.001), and experienced worse fatigue (P = 0.050). The hierarchical multiple regression showed that self-reported fatigue (VAS/MAF-distress) had a significant but weak association with AMI in RA. Participants with higher percentage body fat had a significantly stronger association with sarcopenia in both OA and RA.



Conclusion
Sarcopenia, when assessed by AMI, does not appear to be strongly associated with self-reported fatigue or physical function in participants with either OA or RA. Higher body fat had a moderately strong association with sarcopenia in this cross-sectional study, suggesting that body composition may be an important factor in the health of patients with longstanding OA or RA.",10,"['was performed', 'was explored', 'assessed by ami, does not appear to be strongly associated with self-reported fatigue or physical function in participants with either oa']",3,3,0.3,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217462,"Sarcopenia in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis: The association with self-reported fatigue, physical function and obesity"

Aim
To determine the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis, socio-cultural practices and health seeking behaviour of tribal people in four districts of Odisha.



Methodology
This was an action research study with qualitative and quantitative design following a sequential approach implemented in a 4-phased manner. It was carried out in the 6 selected villages from July,2015 to June,2017. The screening for active TB among chest symptomatics is followed as per the guidelines of the (RNTCP) Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program in India.



Results
In all, 1455 households were surveyed in the 6 tribal dominated villages of 4 districts, namely Balangir, Dhenkanal, Kandhamal and Mayurbhanj. Total population of the villages was 6681. Based on the eligibility, 5144 (97.7%) individuals were screened. About 139 (2.3%) could not be screened due to non-availability in their households during day time. Out of the screened individuals (5144), 126 chest symptomatics were identified. Sputum samples were collected from them and sent to the National Reference Laboratory, RMRC, Bhubaneswar using public transport and maintaining cold chain. Out of 126 chest symptomatics, 35 patients were found to be having active TB disease and 18 were culture positive. The prevalence of pulmonary TB is 0.68%. The risk factors seemed to be ignorance about TB symptoms, addiction to alcoholic drinks, difficulty reaching the health facilities owing to the long distances, lack of communication and transport. In addition, other morbidities like Malaria, diabetes, hypertension, malnutrition, etc. were observed in the tribes of the study sites.



Conclusion
TB control programs need further strengthening in the tribal dominated regions. This study is the first of its kind in this State.",16,"['was carried', 'is followed', 'were surveyed', 'were screened', 'be screened', 'were identified', 'were collected', 'were found', 'were observed']",9,8,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227083,"Prevalence, risk factors and health seeking behaviour of pulmonary tuberculosis in four tribal dominated districts of Odisha: Comparison with studies in other regions of India"
"Abstract

Aim
To develop and evaluate an evidence-based and theory driven program for the primary prevention of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).



Design
A pre-intervention / post-intervention / follow up control group design with clustered random allocation of participants to groups was used. The “control” group received “Training as Usual” (TAU).



Method
Participants were 45 career recruits within the recruit school at the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) in Western Australia. The intervention group received a four-hour resilience training intervention (Mental Agility and Psychological Strength training) as part of their recruit training school curriculum. Data was collected at baseline and at 6- and 12-months post intervention.



Results
We found no evidence that the intervention was effective in the primary prevention of mental health issues, nor did we find any significant impact of MAPS training on social support or coping strategies. A significant difference across conditions in trauma knowledge is indicative of some impact of the MAPS program.



Conclusion
While the key hypotheses were not supported, this study is the first randomised control trial investigating the primary prevention of PTSD. Practical barriers around the implementation of this program, including constraints within the recruit school, may inform the design and implementation of similar programs in the future.

Aim
To develop and test a new adverse drug reaction (ADR) causality assessment tool (CAT).



Methods
A comparison between seven assessors of a new CAT, formulated by an expert focus group, compared with the Naranjo CAT in 80 cases from a prospective observational study and 37 published ADR case reports (819 causality assessments in total).



Main Outcome Measures
 Utilisation of causality categories, measure of disagreements, inter-rater reliability (IRR).



Results
The Liverpool ADR CAT, using 40 cases from an observational study, showed causality categories of 1 unlikely, 62 possible, 92 probable and 125 definite (1, 62, 92, 125) and ‘moderate’ IRR (kappa 0.48), compared to Naranjo (0, 100, 172, 8) with ‘moderate’ IRR (kappa 0.45). In a further 40 cases, the Liverpool tool (0, 66, 81, 133) showed ‘good’ IRR (kappa 0.6) while Naranjo (1, 90, 185, 4) remained ‘moderate’.



Conclusion
The Liverpool tool assigns the full range of causality categories and shows good IRR. Further assessment by different investigators in different settings is needed to fully assess the utility of this tool.",7,['is needed'],1,1,0.14285714285714285,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0028096,Development and Inter-Rater Reliability of the Liverpool Adverse Drug Reaction Causality Assessment Tool
"Abstract

Aim
To develop and test a new tool to assess the avoidability of adverse drug reactions that is suitable for use in paediatrics but which is also applicable to a variety of other settings.



Methods
The study involved multiple phases. Preliminary work involved using the Hallas scale and a modification of the existing Hallas scale, to assess two different sets of adverse drug reaction (ADR) case reports. Phase 1 defined, modified and refined a new tool using multidisciplinary teams. Phase 2 involved the assessment of 50 ADR case reports from a prospective study of paediatric inpatients by individual assessors. Phase 3 compared assessments with the new tool for individuals and groups in comparison to the ‘gold standard’ (the avoidability outcome set by a panel of senior investigators: an experienced clinical pharmacologist, paediatrician and pharmacist).



Main Outcome Measures
Inter-rater reliability (IRR), measure of disagreement and utilization of avoidability categories.



Results
Preliminary work—Pilot phase: results for the original Hallas cases were fair and pairwise kappa scores ranged from 0.21 to 0.36. Results for the modified Hallas cases were poor, pairwise kappa scores ranged from 0.06 to 0.16.
Phase 1: on initial use of the new tool, agreement between the two multidisciplinary groups was found on 13/20 cases with a kappa score of 0.29 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.62).
Phase 2: the assessment of 50 ADR case reports by six individual reviewers yielded pairwise kappa scores ranging from poor to good 0.12 to 0.75 and percentage exact agreement (%EA) ranged from 52–90%.
Phase 3: Percentage exact agreement ranged from 35–70%. Overall, individuals had better agreement with the ‘gold standard’.



Conclusion
Avoidability assessment is feasible but needs careful attention to methods. The Liverpool ADR avoidability assessment tool showed mixed IRR. We have developed and validated a method for assessing the avoidability of ADRs that is transparent, more objective than previous methods and that can be used by individuals or groups.",16,"['outcome set', 'was found', 'can be used']",3,3,0.1875,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169393,Development of the Liverpool Adverse Drug Reaction Avoidability Assessment Tool
"Abstract

Aim
To estimate the economic burden of common health problems associated with pregnancy and childbirth, such as incontinence, mental health problems, or gestational diabetes, excluding acute complications of labour or birth, or severe acute adverse maternal outcomes.



Methods
Searches for relevant studies were carried out to November 2019 in Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and EconLit databases. After initial screening, all results were reviewed for inclusion by two authors. An adapted version of a previously developed checklist for cost-of-illness studies was used for quality appraisal. All costs were converted to 2018 Euro using national consumer price indices and purchasing power parity conversion factors.



Results
Thirty-eight relevant studies were identified, some of which reported incremental costs for more than one health problem (16 gestational diabetes, 13 overweight/obesity, 8 mental health, 4 hypertensive disorders, 2 nausea and vomiting, 2 epilepsy, 1 intimate partner violence). A high level of heterogeneity was observed in both the methods used, and the incremental cost estimates obtained for each morbidity. Average incremental costs tended to be higher in studies that modelled a hypothetical cohort of women using data from a range of sources (compared to analyses of primary data), and in studies set in the United States. No studies that examined the economic burden of some common pregnancy-related morbidities, such as incontinence, pelvic girdle pain, or sexual health problems, were identified.



Conclusion
Our findings indicate that maternal morbidity is associated with significant costs to health systems and society, but large gaps remain in the evidence base for the economic burden of some common health problems associated with pregnancy and childbirth. More research is needed to examine the economic burden of a range of common maternal health problems, and future research should adopt consistent methodological approaches to ensure comparability of results.",11,"['were carried', 'were reviewed', 'was used', 'were converted', 'were identified', 'was observed', 'were identified', 'is needed']",8,8,0.7272727272727273,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227377,Economic burden of maternal morbidity – A systematic review of cost-of-illness studies

Aim
To evaluate drug therapy for alcohol dependence in the 12 months after first diagnosis in UK primary care.



Design
Open cohort study.



Setting
General practices contributing data to the UK Clinical Practice Research Database.



Participants
39,980 people with an incident diagnosis of alcohol dependence aged 16 years or older between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 2013.



Main outcome measure
Use of pharmacotherapy (acamprosate, disulfiram, naltrexone, baclofen and topiramate) to promote abstinence from alcohol or reduce drinking to safe levels in the first 12 months after a recorded diagnosis of alcohol dependence.



Findings
Only 4,677 (11.7%) of the cohort received relevant pharmacotherapy in the 12 months following diagnosis. Of the 35,303 that did not receive pharmacotherapy, 3,255 (9.2%) received psychosocial support. The remaining 32,048 (80.2%) did not receive either mode of treatment in the first 12 months. Factors that independently reduced the likelihood of receiving pharmacotherapy included: being male (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.74; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.78); older (65-74 years: OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.77); being from a practice based in the most deprived quintile (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.64); and being located in Northern Ireland (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.91). The median duration to initiation of pharmacotherapy was 0.80 months (95% CI 0.70 to 1.00) for acamprosate and 0.60 months (95% CI 0.43 to 0.73) for disulfiram. Persistence analysis for those receiving acamprosate and disulfiram revealed that many patients never received a repeat prescription; persistence at 6 months was 27.7% for acomprosate and 33.2% for disulfiram. The median duration of therapy was 2.10 months (95% CI 1.87 to 2.53) for acamprosate and 3.13 months (95% CI 2.77 to 3.36) for disulfiram.



Conclusion
Drug therapy to promote abstinence in alcohol dependent patients was low, with the majority of patients receiving no therapy, either psychological or pharmacological. When drug therapy was prescribed, persistence was low with most patients receiving only one prescription. Our data show that treatment for alcohol dependence is haphazard, and there is an urgent need to explore strategies for improving clinical management of this patient group.",14,"['being located', 'was prescribed']",2,2,0.14285714285714285,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173272,Drug therapy for alcohol dependence in primary care in the UK: A Clinical Practice Research Datalink study

Aim
To evaluate structural changes in the retina and their correlation with visual dysfunction in patients with multiple sclerosis.



Methods
Patients with multiple sclerosis (n = 84) and healthy controls (n = 84) underwent structural evaluation of the retinal nerve fiber layer, and macular and ganglion cell layer thicknesses using Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). All subjects underwent high and low contrast visual acuity, color vision (using the Farnsworth and L´Anthony desaturated D15 color tests), and contrast sensitivity vision using the Pelli Robson chart and CSV 1000E test.



Results
Macular, retinal nerve fiber layer, and ganglion cell layer thinning was observed in multiple sclerosis patients compared to healthy controls (p<0.05). High- and low-contrast visual acuity and contrast sensitivity vision at four different spatial frequencies were significantly reduced in comparison with healthy subjects (p<0.05). Macular, retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer measurements correlated with high and low contrast visual acuity, and contrast sensitivity vision. Contrast sensitivity vision was the functional parameter that most strongly correlated with the structural measurements in multiple sclerosis and was associated with ganglion cell layer measurements. The L´Anthony color vision score (age-corrected color confusion index) was associated with macular measurements.



Conclusions
Patients with multiple sclerosis had visual dysfunction that correlated with structural changes evaluated by SD-OCT. Macular and ganglion cell layer measurements may be good indicators of visual impairment in multiple sclerosis patients.",9,"['was observed', 'were significantly reduced']",2,2,0.2222222222222222,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157293,Relationship between Visual Dysfunction and Retinal Changes in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis

Aim
To evaluate the caries prevalence and related variables in Type 1 diabetic and non-diabetic children and among the diabetic children according to their metabolic status.



Methods
Sixty-eight diabetic and 136 non-diabetic children, matching by gender and age (4–14 years) were enrolled. The diabetic children were divided: a) 20 children in good metabolic control (Hb1ac≤7.5) and b) 48 children in bad metabolic control (Hb1ac>7.5). Dietary and oral hygiene habits were investigated. Caries status was registered using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System. Oral microflora was analysed using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridisation method. Plaque acidogenicity was recorded after a sucrose rinse.



Results
Sugared beverage and snack intake was higher in diabetic group compared to non-diabetic group (p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively) and in subjects in bad metabolic control (p = 0.03 and p<0.01, respectively). Oral hygiene habits were similar, except for the use of fluoridated adjuvants, higher in non-diabetic children (p = 0.04). No statistically significant differences were observed regarding caries figures, but a higher number of caries free subjects was found in diabetic subjects in good metabolic control (p<0.01). Significant difference for the main cariogenic bacteria was found between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects (p<0.05). The pH values showed statistically significant differences between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects and between diabetic subjects in good and bad metabolic control (p<0.01).



Conclusions
Diabetic children in good metabolic control might even be considered at low caries risk, while those in bad metabolic control showed an oral environment prone to a high caries risk.",13,"['were enrolled', 'were divided', 'were investigated', 'was registered', 'was analysed', 'was recorded', 'were observed', 'was found', 'was found', 'be considered']",10,9,0.6923076923076923,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188451,Evaluation of the difference in caries experience in diabetic and non-diabetic children—A case control study

Aim
To evaluate the feasibility and effect of a 10-session creative arts in psychotherapy group programme on posttraumatic stress symptoms, behavioural problems, and posttraumatic growth, in children who experienced a traumatic event.



Design
A multicentre non-randomized controlled trial with a treatment and a control condition conducted in South Africa (4 sites).



Methods
125 children aged 7 to 13 years were assigned either to the treatment condition receiving creative arts in psychotherapy or a control condition with a low-level supportive programme without treatment. Attrition rates were 63.4% and in total 47 children completed the programme and questionnaires assessing posttraumatic stress, posttraumatic growth and behaviour problems both at baseline and follow-up; 23 in the treatment group and 24 in the control group. Adjusted mean differences were analysed using ANCOVA with bootstrapping.



Results
Results showed that both hyperarousal symptoms (d = 0.61) and avoidance symptoms (d = 0.41) decreased more in the treatment group compared to the control group. There was no significant effect of the intervention found for reported levels of behavioural problems and posttraumatic growth.



Conclusion
In spite of severe challenges implementing and executing this pioneering study in underprivileged areas of South Africa, support was found for creative arts in psychotherapy reducing hyperarousal and avoidance symptoms, but not for other symptoms.

Aim
To evaluate the incidence and progression of myopia and factors associated with progression of myopia in school going children in Delhi.



Methods
Prospective longitudinal study of 10,000 school children aged 5 to 15 years screened after an interval of 1 year to identify new myopes (Spherical Equivalent≤ -0.5D) and progression of myopia in previously diagnosed myopic children. Association between risk factors and progression was analyzed using adjusted odds ratio.



Results
Of the 9,616 children re-screened (97.3% coverage), annual incidence of myopia was 3.4%with mean dioptric change of -1.09 ± 0.55. There was a significant higher incidence of myopia in younger children compared to older children (P = 0.012) and among girls compared to boys (P = 0.002). Progression was observed in 49.2%children with mean dioptric change of -0.27 ± 0.42 diopters. The demographic and behavioral risk factors were analyzed for children with progression (n = 629) and adjusted odds ratio values were estimated. Hours of reading-writing/week (p<0.001), use of computers/ video games (P<0.001) and watching television (P = 0.048) were significant risk factors for progression of myopia. Outdoor activities / time spent outdoors> 2 hours in a day were protective with an inverse association with progression of myopia (P< 0.001).



Conclusion
Myopia is an important health issue in India and is associated with long hours of reading and screen time with use of computers and video games. An annual eye vision screening should be conducted, and outdoor activities be promoted to prevent the increase of myopia among school children.",11,"['was analyzed', 'was observed', 'were analyzed', 'were estimated', 'time spent', 'should be conducted', 'be promoted']",7,5,0.45454545454545453,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0189774,Incidence and progression of myopia and associated factors in urban school children in Delhi: The North India Myopia Study (NIM Study)
"Abstract

Aim
To evaluate the prevalence of alcohol consumption among university students during late adolescence and young adulthood and to identify the associated factors.



Material and Methods
Cohort study among university students in Spain (n = 1382). Heavy Episodic Drinking (HED) and Risky Consumption (RC) were measured with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) at ages 18, 20, 22, 24 and 27 years. Data on potential factors associated with alcohol use were obtained with an additional questionnaire. Multilevel logistic regression for repeated measures was used to obtain adjusted OR (Odds Ratios).



Results
The rates of prevalence of RC were lower, but not statistically significant, in women. The age-related changes in these rates were similar in both genders, and the prevalence of RC peaked at 20 years. By contrast, the prevalence of HED was significantly lower in women and peaked at 18 years in women and at 22 years in men. Multivariate models showed that early age of onset of alcohol use (OR = 10.6 and OR = 6.9 for women; OR = 8.3 and OR = 8.2 for men) and positive expectations about alcohol (OR = 7.8 and OR = 4.5 for women; OR = 3.6 and OR = 3.3 for men) were the most important risk factors for RC and HED. Living away from the family home was also a risk factor for both consumption patterns among women (OR = 3.16 and OR = 2.34), while a high maternal education level was a risk factor for RC among both genders (OR = 1.62 for women; OR = 2.49 for men).



Conclusions
Alcohol consumption decreases significantly at the end of youth, with higher rates of prevalence and a later peak among men. Prevention strategies should focus on beliefs and expectations about alcohol and on delaying the age of onset. Women are at particular risk for these consumption patterns if they live away from their parents. Belonging to a high-income family is a strong risk factor for RC.",14,"['were measured', 'were obtained', 'was used']",3,3,0.21428571428571427,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165514,Identifying Predictors and Prevalence of Alcohol Consumption among University Students: Nine Years of Follow-Up

Aim
To evaluate the reliability of isometric peak force (IPF) in a novel “long-length” 90°Hip:20°Knee (90:20) strength test and to compare the simulated soccer match induced fatigue-recovery profile of IPF in this test with that of an isometric 90°Hip:90°Knee (90:90) position test.



Methods
Twenty semi-professional soccer players volunteered for the study of which 14 participated in the first part of the study which assessed 90:20 reliability (age = 21.3 ± 2.5 years, height = 1.79 ± 0.07 m, body mass = 73.2 ± 8.8 kg), while 17 completed the second part of the study evaluating fatigue-recovery (age 21.2±2.4 yrs., height = 180 ± 0.09 m, body mass 73.8 ± 8.9 kg). We evaluated the inter-session reliability of IPF in two 90:20 test protocols (hands on the wall (HW); and hands on chest (HC)) both performed on two occasions, 7 days apart. We then assessed 90:20 (HC) and 90:90 IPF immediately before (PRE) and after (POST) after a simulated soccer match protocol (BEAST90mod) and 48 (+48 h) and 72 hours (+72 h) later.



Results
Part one: the 90:20 showed moderate to high overall reliability (CV’s of 7.3% to 11.0%) across test positions and limbs. CV’s were lower in the HW than HC in the dominant (7.3% vs 11.0%) but the opposite happened in the non-dominant limb where CV’s were higher in the HW than HC (9.7% vs 7.3%). Based on these results, the HC position was used in part two of the study. Part two: 90:20 and 90:90 IPF was significantly lower POST compared to PRE BEAST90mod across all testing positions (p<0.001). IPF was significantly lower at +48 h compared to PRE in the 90:20 in both limbs (Dominant: p<0.01,Non-dominant: p≤0.05), but not in the 90:90. At +72 h, IPF was not significantly different from PRE in either test.



Conclusions
Simple to implement posterior IPF tests can help to define recovery from competition and training load in football and, potentially, in other multiple sprint athletes. Testing posterior chain IPF in a more knee extended 90:20 position may provide greater sensitivity to fatigue at 48 h post simulated competition than testing in the 90:90 position, but also may require greater degree of familiarization due to more functional testing position.",12,['was used'],1,1,0.08333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0206561,A comparison of the isometric force fatigue-recovery profile in two posterior chain lower limb tests following simulated soccer competition

Aim
To evaluate the safety of 1.25mg and 2mg intravitreal ziv-aflibercept (IVZ) in Ghanaian eyes with choroido-retinal vascular diseases.



Design
Prospective, randomised, double blind, interventional study.



Methods
Twenty patients with centre involving macular oedema in diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and neovascular age-related macular degeneration were assigned to 2 groups receiving 3 doses of 1.25mg/0.05ml (group 1) and 2mg/0.08ml IVZ (Group 2) at 4 weekly intervals. Safety data was collected after 30 minutes, 1 and 7 days, and 4, 8 and 12 weeks after injection. Changes in continuous variables were compared using paired t-test and categorical variables were compared using chi-square test of proportions. Repeated-Measures ANOVA with nesting test was used to compare variations in continuous variables by IVZ dose over time. Primary outcome measures were ocular and systemic adverse events at 4 weeks.



Results
Eleven females and nine males, with mean age of 63.2± 7.3 years were included. Ocular adverse events included subconjunctival haemorrhage in 1 eye, intraocular pressure (IOP) >21mmHg at 30 minutes in 6 eyes and mild pain in 3 eyes at 1-day. There was no significant difference in IOP rise between the 2 groups at 30 minutes (p = 0.21). No other ocular or systemic adverse events were observed. There was significant improvement in the best corrected visual acuity (LogMAR) from 0.95±0.6 to 0.6±0.4 (p<0.01) and 0.47±0.3 (p<0.01), reduction in central subfield foveal thickness from 405.9±140 um at baseline to 255.6±75 um (p<0.01) and 238±88 um (p<0.01) at 4 and 12 weeks respectively, although no difference was observed between the 2 groups (p = 0.34).

Aim
To examine patterns of hazardous, harmful and dependent drinking across different socio-economic groups, and how this relationship may be explained by common mental disorder.



Methods and findings
Between 2011–2013, 1,052 participants (age range 17–91, 53% female) were interviewed for Phase 2 of the South East London Community Health study. Latent class analysis was used to define six groups based on multiple indicators of socio-economic status in three domains. Alcohol use (low risk, hazardous, harmful/dependent) was measured using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and the presence of common mental disorder was measured using the revised Clinical Interview Schedule. Multinomial regression was used to explore associations with hazardous, harmful and dependent alcohol use, including after adjustment for common mental disorder.
Harmful and dependent drinking was more common among people in Class 2 ‘economically inactive renters’ (relative risk ratio (RRR) 3.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07–8.71), Class 3 ‘economically inactive homeowners’ (RRR 4.11, 95% CI 1.19–14.20) and Class 6 ‘professional renters’ (RRR 3.51, 95% CI 1.14–10.78) than in Class 1 ‘professional homeowners’. Prevalent common mental disorder explained some of the increased risk of harmful or dependent drinking in Class 2, but not Class 3 or 6.



Conclusions
Across distinct socio-economic groups in a large inner-city sample, we found important differences in harmful and dependent drinking, only some of which were explained by common mental disorder. The increased risk of harmful or dependent drinking across classes which are very distinct from each other suggests differing underlying drivers of drinking across these groups. A nuanced understanding of alcohol use and problems is necessary to understand the inequalities in alcohol harms.",10,"['may be explained', 'were interviewed', 'was used', 'was measured', 'was measured', 'was used', 'explained by common mental disorder']",7,6,0.6,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229093,"Associations between interrelated dimensions of socio-economic status, higher risk drinking and mental health in South East London: A cross-sectional study"
"Abstract

Aim
To examine temporal changes in opiate and stimulant use among patients in substance abuse treatment over a ten-year observation period and to explore the role of contextual factors, mental health disorders and psychosocial factors on these changes.



Methods
A cohort of 481 patients was prospectively interviewed at admission to treatment and after 1, 2, 7 and 10 years. The sample was recruited from 20 facilities in the Greater Oslo region, Norway.



Results
The majority of patients were poly-drug users and 80% had used both opiates and stimulants the last 30 days prior to treatment admission. Last-month use of heroin, other opiates, cocaine and amphetamines declined from 80% to 34% at the end of the observation period. The most substantial reduction was observed between baseline and one-year follow-up. Use of heroin decreased the most from 62% to 16% after 10 years (a reduction of 74%), and the reduction continued from one-year follow-up throughout the observation period. The most important multivariate risk factors for sustained use of these drugs were male gender, having one or both biological parents with severe alcohol or drug problems, having an antisocial personality disorder, and living together with a person who abuses alcohol or drugs. Employment was associated with reduced risk of drug use at 7-year follow-up.



Conclusions
There was a substantial reduction in opiate and stimulant use from baseline to all follow-up assessments, most greatly for heroin. Findings regarding sustained use could suggest familial transmission and the challenges of preventive strategies and treatment efforts in an intergenerational context. Co-occurrence between drug abuse and mental health problems highlights the need of highly specialized competence in SUD treatment.",13,"['was prospectively interviewed', 'was recruited', 'was observed']",3,3,0.23076923076923078,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0190381,"Changes in opiate and stimulant use through 10 years: The role of contextual factors, mental health disorders and psychosocial factors in a prospective SUD treatment cohort study"
"Abstract

Aim
to examine whether the severity of different categories of stressful events is associated with continued smoking and alcohol consumption during mid-pregnancy. Also, we explored the explanation of these associations by anxiety and depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Finally, we studied whether the severity of stressful events was associated with the amount of cigarettes and alcohol used by continued users.



Method
we conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from a population-based prospective cohort study. Pregnant women were recruited via midwifery practices throughout The Netherlands. We analyzed women who continued smoking (n = 113) or quit (n = 290), and women who continued alcohol consumption (n = 124) or quit (n = 1403) during pregnancy. Smoking, alcohol consumption, and perceived severity of stressful events were measured at 19 weeks of gestation. The State Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale were filled out at 14 weeks of gestation. Odds ratios were calculated as association measures and indicated the relative increase for the odds of continuation of smoking and alcohol consumption for the maximum severity score compared to the minimum score.



Findings
severity of the following stressful event categories was associated with continued alcohol consumption: ‘conflict with loved ones’ (OR = 10.4, p<0.01), ‘crime related’ (OR = 35.7, p<0.05), ‘pregnancy-specific’ (OR = 13.4, p<0.05), and the total including all events (OR = 17.2, p<0.05). Adjustment for potential confounders (age, parity and educational level) did not notably change the estimates. There was no association of anxiety and depressive symptoms with continued smoking or alcohol consumption. No associations emerged for continued smoking and severity of stressful events. The amount of cigarettes and alcohol consumption among continued users was not associated with severity of stressful events.



Conclusions
Our findings may be relevant for health care providers, in particular midwives and general practitioners. The impact of stressful events may be considered when advising pregnant women on smoking and alcohol consumption.",16,"['were recruited', 'were measured', 'were calculated', 'may be considered']",4,4,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0086359,Stressful Events and Continued Smoking and Continued Alcohol Consumption during Mid-Pregnancy
"Abstract

Aim
To explore the barriers and facilitators perceived by home caregivers regarding their involvement in the home care of people with pressure injuries.



Background
Although home caregivers are key in the process of caring for people with pressure injuries, little is known about their perceptions regarding their involvement in the same.



Methods
A qualitative study based on grounded theory involving a theoretical sample of 15 home caregivers of people with pressure injuries within the health district of Puertollano, Spain.



Results
This study identified three barriers (feminization of care, necessary life adaptations as a home caregiver, and the organization of health services) and three facilitators (the perceived family duty for caring, willingness to provide care, and satisfaction with the care received on behalf of primary care services) associated with caregiver involvement in the home care of pressure injuries.



Conclusions
The care of a person with pressure injuries is perceived as a duty and requires important adaptations affecting the home caregiver’s personal, social and work life. The emotional closeness and trust that develops between a patient and the primary care staff equals an involvement which, in turn, also has positive results for both the home caregiver and the patient.",6,"['is known', 'is perceived']",2,2,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0226359,Barriers and facilitators for caregiver involvement in the home care of people with pressure injuries: A qualitative study
"Abstract

Aim
To explore the experiences of women with severe maternal morbidity and their perception of the quality of health care.



Background
The exploration of factors associated with severe maternal morbidity has emerged as an alternative strategy in reducing maternal mortality. This approach is useful for the evaluation and improvement of maternal health services.



Design
Included a comprehensive search, appraisal of reports of qualitative studies, the classification of studies and the synthesis of findings.



Data Sources
A literature search was conducted through nine databases for articles published between January 1980 and August 2013.



Review Methods
The quality of included studies was assessed with a modified Critical Appraisal Skills Program tool. The synthesis applied a meta-ethnographic approach. It involved (1) identifying and comparing the findings; (2) creating a parsimonious thematic structure and (3) searching for disconfirming data.



Results
Nine studies published between 2005 and 2012, involving 292 women with severe maternal morbidity, were included. Three key themes were identified: 'provision of care', 'severe maternal morbidity' and 'health care seeking behavior'. Barriers to the access and utilization of heath care services were identified.



Conclusion
The findings appear to suggest that mental and physical health outcomes of women who experienced severe maternal morbidity were poor. There is a need to identify the persistence and severity of these outcomes over a longer period of time. More realistic and less biased information may be obtained in community-based interviews. The impact of potential negative fetal outcomes would be a strong influencing factor for the women. These findings may help to increase awareness of the non-physical components of severe maternal morbidity and provide guidance for professionals regarding preventive measures.",16,"['was conducted', 'was assessed', 'were included', 'were identified', 'were identified', 'may be obtained']",6,6,0.375,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130452,Metasynthesis: Experiences of Women with Severe Maternal Morbidity and Their Perception of the Quality of Health Care
"Abstract

Aim
To explore the relationship between Health belief model (HBM) and children and adolescents' unintentional injury risk behavior, to add some useful information for injury prevention.



Methodology
We investigated injury related health risk behavior and health belief status of students at primary schools grade 3 to 4, in a Safe Community, in Shanghai. Self-administered injury questionnaires were used to investigate risk behavior of students and HBM factors.



Principal Findings
The prevalence of risk behavior among students reported in this community was high. HBM scores showed differences between two groups of students classified by whether they had risk behavior or not. Self-efficacy was highly related with the status of socio-psychological behavior.



Significance
HBM has been widely used in explaining the disease-related behavior; however, it has been seldom used in injury-related behavior. The study demonstrated important relation of HBM to students' injury issues, and HBM could explain injury related behavior as well, especially for traffic injury-related behavior. When developing injury prevention strategies, we can take it into account.",7,"['were used', 'has been widely used', 'has been seldom used']",3,2,0.2857142857142857,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0070563,Injury Related Risk Behaviour: A Health Belief Model-Based Study of Primary School Students in a Safe Community in Shanghai

Aim
To explore the views of Malaysian healthcare professionals (HCPs) on stakeholders’ decision making roles in localized prostate cancer (PCa) treatment.



Methods
Qualitative interviews and focus groups were conducted with HCPs treating PCa. Data was analysed using a thematic approach. Four in-depth interviews and three focus group discussions were conducted between December 2012 and March 2013 using a topic guide. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed thematically.



Findings
The participants comprised private urologists (n = 4), government urologists (n = 6), urology trainees (n = 6), government policy maker (n = 1) and oncologists (n = 3). HCP perceptions of the roles of the three parties involved (HCPs, patients, family) included: HCP as the main decision maker, HCP as a guide to patients’ decision making, HCP as a facilitator to family involvement, patients as main decision maker and patient prefers HCP to decide. HCPs preferred to share the decision with patients due to equipoise between prostate treatment options. Family culture was important as family members often decided on the patient’s treatment due to Malaysia’s close-knit family culture.



Conclusions
A range of decision making roles were reported by HCPs. It is thus important that stakeholder roles are clarified during PCa treatment decisions. HCPs need to cultivate an awareness of sociocultural norms and family dynamics when supporting non-Western patients in making decisions about PCa.",12,"['were conducted', 'was analysed', 'were conducted', 'were reported', 'are clarified']",5,5,0.4166666666666667,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0142812,To Share or Not to Share: Malaysian Healthcare Professionals' Views on Localized Prostate Cancer Treatment Decision Making Roles
"Abstract

Aim
To gain a better understanding of the complex relationships of different measures of social position, educational level and income with alcohol consumption in England.



Method
Between March 2014 and April 2018 data were collected on n = 57,807 alcohol drinkers in England taking part in the Alcohol Toolkit Study (ATS). Respondents completed the AUDIT-C measure of frequency of alcohol consumption, amount consumed on a typical day and binge drinking frequency. The first two questions were used to derive a secondary measure of quantity: average weekly unit consumption. Socio-economic factors measured were: social-grade (based on occupation), employment status, educational qualifications, home and car ownership and income. Models were constructed using ridge regression to assess the contribution of each predictor taking account of high collinearity. Models were adjusted for age, gender and ethnicity.



Results
The strongest predictor of frequency of alcohol consumption was social-grade. Those in the two lowest occupational categories of social grade (e.g. semi-skilled and unskilled manual workers, and unemployed, pensioners, casual workers) has fewer drinking occasions than those in professional-managerial occupations (β = -0.29, 95%CI -0.34 to -0.25; β = -0.31, 95%CI -0.33 to -0.29). The strongest predictor of consumed volume and binge drinking frequency was lower educational attainment: those whose highest qualification was an A-level (i.e. college/high school qualification) drank substantially more on a typical day (β = 0.28, 95%CI 0.25 to 0.31) and had a higher weekly unit intake (β = 3.55, 95%CI 3.04 to 4.05) than those with a university qualification. They also reported a higher frequency of binge drinking (β = 0.11, 95%CI 0.09 to 0.14). Housing tenure was a strong predictor of all drinking outcomes, while employment status and car ownership were the weakest predictors of most outcomes.



Conclusion
Social-grade and educational attainment appear to be the strongest socioeconomic predictors of alcohol consumption indices in England, followed closely by housing tenure. Employment status and car ownership have the lowest predictive power.",13,"['were collected', 'were used', 'were constructed', 'were adjusted']",4,4,0.3076923076923077,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0209442,Associations between socio-economic factors and alcohol consumption: A population survey of adults in England
"Abstract

Aim
To identify and describe the characteristics of naturally occurring patterns of exercise, sitting in leisure time and at work and cardiorespiratory fitness, and the association of such profiles with metabolic risk factors, perceived health, and perceived symptoms.



Methods
64,970 participants (42% women, 18–75 years) participating in an occupational health service screening in 2014–2018 were included. Exercise and sitting were self-reported. Cardiorespiratory fitness was estimated using a submaximal cycle test. Latent profile analysis was used to identify profiles. BMI and blood pressure were assessed through physical examination. Perceived back/neck pain, overall stress, global health, and sleeping problems were self-reported.



Results
Six profiles based on exercise, sitting in leisure time and at work and cardiorespiratory fitness were identified and labelled; Profile 1 “Inactive, low fit and average sitting in leisure, with less sitting at work”; Profile 2 “Inactive, low fit and sedentary”; Profile 3 “Active and average fit, with less sitting at work”; Profile 4 “Active, average fit and sedentary in leisure, with a sedentary work” (the most common profile, 35% of the population); Profile 5 “Active and fit, with a sedentary work”; Profile 6 “Active and fit, with less sitting at work”. Some pairwise similarities were found between profiles (1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6), mainly based on similar levels of exercise, leisure time sitting and fitness, which translated into similar dose-response associations with the outcomes. In general, profile 1 and 2 demonstrated most adverse metabolic and perceived health, profile 4 had a more beneficial health than profile 3, as did profile 6 compared to profile 5.



Conclusions
The present results implies a large variation in exercise, sitting, and fitness when studying naturally occurring patterns, and emphasize the possibility to target exercise, sitting time, and/or fitness in health enhancing promotion intervention and strategies.",10,"['were included', 'was estimated', 'was used', 'were assessed', 'were identified', 'were found']",6,6,0.6,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0232210,"Latent profile analysis patterns of exercise, sitting and fitness in adults – Associations with metabolic risk factors, perceived health, and perceived symptoms"
"Abstract

Aim
To identify long-term effects of preterm birth and of periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) on cortical thickness (CTh). To study the relationship between CTh and cognitive-behavioral abnormalities.



Methods
We performed brain magnetic resonance imaging on 22 preterm children with PVL, 14 preterm children with no evidence of PVL and 22 full-term peers. T1-weighted images were analyzed with FreeSurfer software. All participants underwent cognitive and behavioral assessments by means of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).



Results
We did not find global CTh differences between the groups. However, a thinner cortex was found in left postcentral, supramarginal, and caudal middle rostral gyri in preterm children with no evidence of PVL than in the full-term controls, while PVL preterm children showed thicker cortex in right pericalcarine and left rostral middle frontal areas than in preterm children with no evidence of PVL. In the PVL group, internalizing and externalizing scores correlated mainly with CTh in frontal areas. Attentional scores were found to be higher in PVL and correlated with CTh increments in right frontal areas.



Interpretation
The preterm group with no evidence of PVL, when compared with full-term children, showed evidence of a different pattern of regional thinning in the cortical gray matter. In turn, PVL preterm children exhibited atypical increases in CTh that may underlie their prevalent behavioral problems.",12,"['were analyzed', 'was found', 'were found']",3,3,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042148,Cortical Thickness and Behavior Abnormalities in Children Born Preterm

Aim
To identify potential predictors of community integration in individuals after stroke using a residential setting-based strategy.



Method
A prospective cohort of post-stroke individuals was recruited from the Stroke Unit of the Roberto Santos General Hospital (UAVC-HGRS). All included individuals were aged over 18 years, received a diagnosis of ischemic stroke confirmed by neuroimaging and resided in the city of Salvador (Bahia, Brazil). Following discharge from the stroke unit, the individuals themselves, or their responsible parties, were contacted by telephone to schedule a home visit no less than three months after discharge. All subjects were examined in their homes, at which time the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) was also applied. A robust linear regression model was used to assess community reintegration using CIQ score as the outcome variable.



Results
A total of 124 individuals effectively fulfilled the eligibility criteria: 51.6% were females, the median (IQR) age was 63(53–69) years, 82.3% were non-white, 53.2% were married, the median (IQR) of years of schooling was 6 (4–12) and family income averaged two minimum monthly wages. Investigated individuals presented a median (IQR) NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 7 (4–12). Multivariate linear regression identified the following independent predictors of community integration: age (β = -0.095; 95% CI = -0.165 to -0.025; p = 0.008), diabetes mellitus (β = -2.348; 95% CI = -4.125 to -0.571; p = 0.010), smoking habit (β = -2.951; 95% CI = -5.081 to -0.821; p = 0.007), functional capacity upon hospital discharge (β = 0.168; 95% CI = 0.093 to 0.242; p = <0.001) and stroke severity (β = -0.163; CI = -0.318 to -0.009); p = 0.038).



Conclusions
Regardless of length of time since stroke, individuals present restrictions that compromise their reintegration into their respective communities. The demographic, clinical and functional factors identified herein as potential predictors should be considered when conducting regular follow-up, as well as in the rehabilitation of individuals after stroke with the purpose to identify the interventions necessary to optimize their reintegration into the community.",11,"['was recruited', 'were aged', 'were contacted', 'were examined', 'was also applied', 'was used', 'were married', 'should be considered']",8,7,0.6363636363636364,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233015,Investigating predictors of community integration in individuals after stroke in a residential setting: A longitutinal study

Aim
To investigate abnormalities in automatic information processing related to self- and observer-rated alexithymia, especially with regard to somatization, controlling for confounding variables such as depression and affect.



Sample
89 healthy subjects (60% female), aged 19–71 years (M = 32.1). 58 subjects were additionally rated by an observer.



Measures
Alexithymia (self-rating: TAS-20, observer rating: OAS); automatic information processing (priming task including verbal [illness-related, negative, positive, neutral] and facial [negative, positive, neutral] stimuli); somatoform symptoms (SOMS-7T); confounders: depression (BDI), affect (PANAS).



Results
Higher self-reported alexithymia scores were associated with lower reaction times for negative (r = .19, p < .10) and positive (r = .26, p < .05) verbal primes when the target was illness-related. Self-reported alexithymia was correlated with number (r = .42, p < .01) and intensity of current somatoform symptoms (r = .36, p < .01), but unrelated to observer-rated alexithymia (r = .11, p = .42).



Discussion
Results indicate a faster allocation of attentional resources away from task-irrelevant information towards illness-related stimuli in alexithymia. Considering the close relationship between alexithymia and somatization, these findings are compatible with the theoretical view that alexithymics focus strongly on bodily sensations of emotional arousal. A single observer rating (OAS) does not seem to be an adequate alexithymia-measure in community samples.",9,"['were additionally rated', 'was correlated']",2,2,0.2222222222222222,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129905,Abnormalities in Automatic Processing of Illness-Related Stimuli in Self-Rated Alexithymia

Aim
To investigate the effect of the neighbourhood built environment on trajectories of depression symptom episodes in adults from the general Canadian population.



Research Design and Methods
We used 10 years of data collection (2000/01-2010/11) from the Canadian National Population Health Study (n = 7114). Episodes of depression symptoms were identified using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short-Form. We assessed the presence of local parks, healthy food stores, fast food restaurants, health services and cultural services using geospatial data. We used latent class growth modelling to identify different trajectories of depression symptom episodes in the sample and tested for the effect of neighbourhood variables on the trajectories over time.



Results
We uncovered three distinct trajectories of depression symptom episodes: low prevalence (76.2% of the sample), moderate prevalence (19.2%) and high prevalence of depression symptom episodes (2.8%). The presence of any neighbourhood service (healthy food store, fast-food restaurant, health service, except for cultural service) was significantly associated with a lower probability of a depression symptom episode for those following a trajectory of low prevalence of depression symptom episodes. The presence of a local park was also a significant protective factor in trajectory groups with both low and moderate prevalence of depression symptom episodes. Neighbourhood characteristics did not significantly affect the trajectory of high prevalence of depression symptom episodes.



Conclusions
For individuals following a trajectory of low and moderate prevalence of depression symptom episodes, the neighbourhood built environment was associated with a shift in the trajectory of depression symptom episodes. Future intervention studies are recommended to make policy recommendations.",11,"['were identified', 'are recommended']",2,2,0.18181818181818182,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133603,The Neighbourhood Built Environment and Trajectories of Depression Symptom Episodes in Adults: A Latent Class Growth Analysis

Aim
To investigate the factors predicting adolescent visits to practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).



Methods
A longitudinal cohort study conducted in an adolescent total population in Central Norway (The Nord-Trøndelag Health Studies (HUNT)). In Young-HUNT 1, all inhabitants aged 13 to 19 years (N = 8944, 89% response rate) were invited to participate, and the youngest group (13 to 15 year olds) was surveyed again 4 years later (Young-HUNT 2, N = 2429, 82% response rate). The participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire on health and life style which included a question regarding visits to a CAM practitioner in the last 12 months.



Results
One in eleven (8.7%, 95%CI 7.6-9.8%) had visited a CAM practitioner, an increase of 26% in 4 years (1.8% points). The final multivariable analysis predicted increased odds of an adolescent becoming a CAM visitor four years later (p<0.05) if she or he had previously visited a CAM practitioner (adjOR 3.4), had musculoskeletal pain (adjOR 1.5), had migraine (adjOR 2.3), used asthma medicines (adjOR 1.8) or suffered from another disease lasting more than three months (adjOR 2.1). Being male predicted reduced odds of visiting a CAM practitioner in the future (adjOR 0.6).



Conclusion
We can conclude from this study that future visits to a CAM practitioner are predicted by both predisposing factors (being female, having visited a CAM practitioner previously) and medical need factors (having had musculoskeletal pain, migraine, used asthma medicines or experienced another disease lasting more than three months). None of the specific variables associated with CAM visits were predictive for CAM visits four years later.",10,"['study conducted', 'were invited', 'was surveyed', 'are predicted']",4,3,0.3,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0025719,Predictors for Adolescent Visits to Practitioners of Complementary and Alternative Medicine in a Total Population (the Young-HUNT Studies)

Aim
To investigate the influence of increasing age on clinical presentation, treatment and long-term outcome in patients with inducible paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) without pre-excitation syndromes.



Methods
Clinical and electrophysiological study (EPS) data, as well as long-term clinical outcome (mean follow-up 2.4±4.0 years) were collected in patients referred for regular tachycardia with inducible SVT during EPS without pre-excitation.



Results
Among 1960 referred patients, 301 patients (15.4%) were aged ≥70 (70–97). In this subset, anticoagulants were prescribed in 49 patients following an erroneous diagnosis of atrial tachycardia and 14 were previously erroneously diagnosed with ventricular tachycardia because of wide QRS. Ablation was performed more frequently in patients ≥70 despite more frequent failure and complications. During follow-up, higher risks of AF, stroke, pacemaker implantation and death were observed in patients ≥70 whereas SVT recurrences were similar in both age groups. In multivariable analysis, age ≥70 was independently associated with higher risks of SVT-related adverse events prior to ablation (OR = 1.93, 1.41–2.62, p<0.001), conduction disturbances (OR = 11.27, 5.89–21.50, p<0.001), history of AF (OR = 2.18, 1.22–3.90, p = 0.009) and erroneous diagnosis at baseline (OR = 9.14, 5.93–14.09, p<0.001) as well as high rates of procedural complications (OR = 2.13, 1.19–3.81, p = 0.01) and ablation failure (OR = 1.68, 1.08–2.62, p = 0.02). In contrast, age ≥70 was not significantly associated with a higher risk of AF in multivariable analysis.



Conclusions
A sizeable proportion of patients with inducible SVT without pre-excitation syndromes are elderly. These patients exhibit higher risks of erroneous tachycardia diagnosis prior to EPS as well as failure and/or complication of ablation, but similar risk of SVT recurrence. These results support performing transesophageal EPS in most patients and intracardiac EPS in selected patients. EPS may furthermore prove useful in elderly patients with regular tachycardia, mainly by avoiding treatment based on an erroneous diagnosis.",12,"['were collected', 'were prescribed', 'were previously erroneously diagnosed', 'was performed', 'were observed']",5,4,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0187895,"Influence of advancing age on clinical presentation, treatment efficacy and safety, and long-term outcome of inducible paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia without pre-excitation syndromes: A cohort study of 1960 patients included over 25 years"

Aim
To investigate the longitudinal impacts of pubertal timing and weight status on Internet use in adolescents.



Methods
Three waves of data on a longitudinal cohort of 7th grade students (N = 2430) were retrieved from the Taiwan Youth Project. Univariate and multivariate regression models were applied using crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to examine the concomitant impacts of pubertal timing and weight status on adolescent Internet use.



Results
The dataset identified 210 (8.7%) students using the Internet for more than 20 hours/week, and 81 (3.3%) were viewing pornographic material online. Early maturing and thin-weight adolescents were at 35% and 46% increased risks of spending long hours on Internet use, respectively. While early puberty was associated with online pornography viewing among males (adjusted OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.04–3.28), early puberty was contrarily a protective factor against online gaming in females (adjusted OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36–0.96).

Aim
To investigate the personality in very preterm individuals (VPT; gestational age, GA, <32 weeks) at adult age in two cohorts born in 1974–76 and 1980–82, respectively, and to illuminate the effect of increased survival rates and the clinical implications of deviations in personality.



Method
Demographic data were extracted for all individuals born in Denmark in 1974–76 and 1980–82. From each period one index-group each comprising 150 individuals with the lowest gestational age was selected. Thereafter two control groups born at term were matched by gender, age and residential area. Personality was assessed with the short version of NEO PI-R, and psychiatric diagnoses were obtained from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register.



Results
Of all the individuals born <32 weeks of gestation in 1980–82 67% were alive in 2006 vs. 43% of those born in 1974–76 (p<0.0001). A total of 433 individuals participated in the study, 76% of the VPT groups (n = 227, mean GA = 27.9) and 69% of the control groups (n = 206). There were no significant differences on personality scores between the two VPT groups. Compared to the control groups, the combined VPT groups scored higher on neuroticism (p = 0.005) and agreeableness (p = 0.012), but lower on extraversion (p = 0.002). Psychiatric disorder was strongly associated with higher scores on neuroticism and lower scores on extraversion.



Interpretation
Improved survival of VPT infants was not associated with increased deviances in the personality as adults. The personality traits in VPT individuals differ moderately from those of term born controls. High scores in neuroticism and low scores in extraversion were associated with increased risk psychiatric disorders. VPT adults also showed signs of positive adaptation in the form of an agreeable and confident attitude towards others.



What this paper adds
The much improved survival rate in very preterm infants during the early years of active neonatology was not associated with increased risk of personality deviation. There are signs of positive adaptation in the form of increased agreeableness in young adults born very preterm.",15,"['were extracted', 'was selected', 'were matched', 'was assessed', 'were obtained']",5,3,0.2,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066881,Personality in Adults Who Were Born Very Preterm

Aim
To investigate the reproducibility of the updated Standards for the Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool (STARD 2015) in a set of 106 studies included in a Cochrane diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) systematic review of imaging tests for diagnosing manifest glaucoma.



Methods
One senior rater with DTA methodological and clinical expertise used STARD 2015 on all studies, and each of three raters with different training profiles assessed about a third of the studies.



Results
Raw agreement was very good or almost perfect between the senior rater and an ophthalmology resident with DTA methods training, acceptable with a clinical rater with little DTA methods training, and only moderate with a pharmacology researcher with general, but not DTA, systematic review training and no clinical expertise. The relationship between adherence with STARD 2015 and methodological quality with QUADAS 2 was only partial and difficult to investigate, suggesting that raters used substantial context knowledge in risk of bias assessment.



Conclusions
STARD 2015 proved to be reproducible in this specific research field, provided that both clinical and DTA methodological expertise are achieved through training of its users.",5,['are achieved'],1,1,0.2,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0186209,STARD 2015 was reproducible in a large set of studies on glaucoma

Aim
To investigate whether hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle affect corticospinal excitability, intracortical inhibition (ICI) or facilitation (ICF) in primary motor cortex, and also whether the hormonal fluctuations have any effect on manual dexterity in neurologically intact women.



Materials and Methods
Twenty volunteers (10 Female, 10 Male) were included in this study. The levels of progesterone and estradiol were measured from saliva during the women’s menstrual follicular, ovulation and mid-luteal phases. Motor evoked potentials were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. Single and paired-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) were delivered in a block of 20 stimuli. With paired-pulse technique, 3ms and 10ms inter-stimulus intervals were used to assess ICI and ICF, respectively. The Grooved Pegboard Test (GPT) was completed in each session before the TMS assessments. Male participants were tested at similar time intervals as female participants.



Results
Mixed design ANOVA revealed that GPT score in female participants was significantly lower at the mid-luteal phase compared to the ovulation phase (p = 0.017). However, it was not correlated with progesterone or estrogen fluctuations during the menstrual cycle. The results also showed that the effect of phase, sex and the interaction of phase by sex for resting motor threshold, ICI or ICF were not significant (p > 0.05).



Conclusion
Manual dexterity performance fluctuates during the menstrual cycle in neurologically intact women, which might be due to the balance of the neuromodulatory effects of P4 and E2 in the motor cortex during different phases.",12,"['were included', 'were measured', 'were recorded', 'were delivered', 'were used', 'was completed', 'were tested', 'was not correlated']",8,8,0.6666666666666666,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136081,The Effects of Sex Hormonal Fluctuations during Menstrual Cycle on Cortical Excitability and Manual Dexterity (a Pilot Study)
"Abstract

Aim
To investigate whether items of the SF-12, widely used to assess health outcome in clinical practice and public health research, provide unbiased measurements of underlying constructs in different demographic groups regarding gender, age, educational level and ethnicity.



Methods
We included 23,146 men and women aged 18–70 of Dutch, South-Asian Surinamese, African Surinamese, Ghanaian, Turkish, or Moroccan origin from the HELIUS study. Both multiple group confirmatory factor analyses (MGCFA), with increasingly stringent model constraints (i.e. assessing Configural, Metric, Strong and Strict measurement invariance (MI)), and regression analysis were conducted to establish comparability of SF-12 items across demographic groups.



Results
MI regarding gender, age and education was tested in the ethnic Dutch group (N = 4,615). In each subsequent step of testing MI, change in goodness-of-fit measures did not exceed 0.010 (RMSEA) or 0.004 (CFI). Moreover, goodness-of-fit indices showed good fit for strict invariance models: RMSEA<0.055; CFI>0.97. Regarding ethnicity, RMSEA values of metric and subsequent models fell above 0.055, indicating violation of measurement invariance in factor loadings, thresholds and residual variances. Regression analysis revealed possible age-, education- and ethnicity-related DIF. Adjustment for this DIF had little impact on the magnitude of age and educational differences in physical and mental health, but ethnic inequalities in physical health–and to a lesser extent mental health—were reduced after DIF adjustment.



Conclusions
We found no evidence of violation of measurement invariance of the SF-12 regarding gender, age and educational level. If minor DIF would remain undetected in our MGCFA analyses, we showed that this would have negligible effect on the magnitude of demographic health inequalities. Regarding ethnicity, the SF-12 was not measurement invariant. After accounting for DIF, we observed a reduction of ethnic inequalities in health, in particular in physical health. Caution is warranted when comparing SF-12 scores across population groups with various ethnic backgrounds.",13,"['were conducted', 'was tested', 'were reduced', 'is warranted']",4,4,0.3076923076923077,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0203483,Measurement invariance of the SF-12 among different demographic groups: The HELIUS study

Aim
To provide a Portuguese version of the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP), investigating its validity and reliability in Brazilian patients with COPD.



Methods
This was a cross-sectional study for translation and linguist validation of the Portuguese MDP version for patients with COPD. The process occurred according to the protocol of Mapi Research Trust, Lyon, France. Three scores of MDP were used for the analysis: the immediate unpleasantness of dyspnea (A1); the “immediate perception domain” (S) (sum of A1 plus the sensory descriptors) and the “emotional response domain” (A2) (sum of the emotional descriptors). The questionnaires COPD assessment Test (CAT), Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) and Medical Research Council scale (MRC) were used as anchors to investigate MDP’s validity. Internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach’s alpha. Test–retest reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and concurrent validity was assessed with Spearman correlation coefficients.



Results
Thirty patients with moderate-severe COPD were studied for MDP’s validation analysis (43% male, 63±8years, body mass index [BMI] 27±6Kg/m2, forced expiratory volume in the first second [FEV1] 48±15%predicted, six-minute walking test [6MWT] 464±84m and 84±16%predicted), whereas 10 patients were excluded from the test-retest reliability analysis due to missing data, resulting in a sample of 20 subjects for this purpose (50% male, 62±8years, BMI 27±6Kg/m2, FEV1 48±15%predicted, 6MWT 452±93m and 82±19%predicted). Both samples were similar regarding general characteristics (P>0,05 for all variables). MDP presented strong correlations, i.e., ICC intra-rater: A1: 0.77 (0.48–0.90), S: 0.78 (0.52–0.91), and A2: 0.85 (0.66–0.94), with high internal consistency (Cronbach's α 0.86, 0.88 and 0.92 respectively); and ICC inter-rater: A1: 0.74 (0.46–0.89), S: 0.75 (0.48–0.89) and A2: 0.91 (0.78–0.96) with Cronbach's α 0.85, 0.86 and 0.95 respectively.



Conclusion
The Portuguese version of the MDP is the first valid and reliable instrument to assess dyspnea multidimensionally in Portuguese-speaking patients with COPD.",12,"['were used', 'were used', 'was assessed', 'was assessed', 'was assessed', 'were studied', 'were excluded']",7,6,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0215544,A breath of fresh air: Validity and reliability of a Portuguese version of the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile for patients with COPD

Aim
To summarise and quantify the effect of tobacco smoking on the risk of developing community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.



Methods
We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsychINFO and Web of Science, from inception to October 2017, to identify case-control and cohort studies and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist. The review protocol was registered with the PROSPERO database (CRD42018093943). Study quality was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using a random-effects model.



Results
Of 647 studies identified, 27 studies were included (n = 460,592 participants) in the systematic review. Most of the included studies were of moderate quality with a median score of six (IQR 6–7). Meta-analysis showed that current smokers (pooled OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.70–2.76, n = 13 studies; pooled HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.13–2.04, n = 7 studies) and ex-smokers (pooled OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.26–1.75, n = 8 studies; pooled HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.91–1.52, n = 6 studies) were more likely to develop CAP compared to never smokers. Although the association between passive smoking and risk of CAP in adults of all ages was not statistically significant (pooled OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.94–1.36, n = 5 studies), passive smoking in adults aged ≥65 years was associated with a 64% increased risk of CAP (pooled OR 1.64; 95% CI 1.17–2.30, n = 2 studies). Dose-response analyses of data from five studies revealed a significant trend; current smokers who smoked higher amount of tobacco had a higher risk of CAP.



Conclusion
Tobacco smoke exposure is significantly associated with the development of CAP in current smokers and ex-smokers. Adults aged > 65 years who are passive smokers are also at higher risk of CAP. For current smokers, a significant dose-response relationship is evident.",13,"['was registered', 'was assessed', 'were estimated', 'were included']",4,4,0.3076923076923077,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0220204,Effect of tobacco smoking on the risk of developing community acquired pneumonia: A systematic review and meta-analysis

Aim
To translate and adapt cross-culturally the De Morton Mobility Index from English to Brazilian Portuguese. Furthermore, to test the content validity, reliability, construct validity, interpretability and responsiveness for older hospitalized patients.



Methods
After we carried out the translation and the cross-cultural adaptation of the De Morton Mobility Index and its administration instructions according to international guidelines, the content validity of De Morton Mobility Index was tested by experienced physiotherapists. In the sequence, the reliability, construct validity, interpretability and responsiveness were tested in a test-retest design with 93 older patients hospitalized in ward for clinical reasons. The reliability was tested by Cronbach's alpha coefficient (internal consistency), standard error measurement (agreement), and interclass correlation coefficients (intra and inter-examiner reliability). The construct validity was tested by Pearson's correlation between the De Morton Mobility Index score and the number of steps. Interpretability was analyzed by determining the minimum detectable change and the floor and ceiling effects (frequency of maximum and minimum scoring). Responsiveness was analyzed by effect size.



Results
The Brazilian version of the De Morton Mobility Index was made and adapted. The internal consistency (α = 0.89), reliability intra-(ICC = 0.94) and inter-examiners (ICC = 0.82), agreement were all adequate. The De Morton Mobility Index is validity when correlated with number of steps (r = 0.46). Floor or ceiling effects (<15%) were not observed and the responsiveness was high (ES = 3.65).

Aim
To understand the prevalence of functional constipation in pregnant women and to analyze the impact of its risk factors.



Methods
We searched hospital databases for women who were 37–41 weeks pregnant (1698 cases) from July 2012 to January 2014 in four hospitals in Shanghai. We reviewed factors including general data, living and eating habits, psychological history, past history of defecation in the 6 months before pregnancy and defecation after pregnancy. Data were analyzed using SPSS software.



Results
Pregnant women who were more than 35 years old, with a pre-pregnancy body mass index >24, who were highly educated and employed in a sedentary occupation, showed a higher prevalence of functional constipation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the prevalence of functional constipation among pregnant women was related to age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, diet, exercise, occupation, psychological factors, threatened abortion in early pregnancy and constipation history.



Conclusion
The prevalence rate of functional constipation in pregnant women was significantly higher than in the general population.",7,"['were analyzed', 'was related']",2,2,0.2857142857142857,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133521,Epidemiology and Risk Factors of Functional Constipation in Pregnant Women

Aim
Undergoing diagnostic evaluation for possible cancer can affect health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The aims of this study were to examine the HRQoL in patients undergoing a diagnostic evaluation for possible cancer due to non-specific symptoms and further to investigate the impact of socio-demographic and medical factors associated with HRQoL at the time of diagnosis.



Methods
This was a prospective, multicenter survey study that included patients who were referred for a diagnostic evaluation due to non-specific cancer symptoms. Participants completed the EORTC-QLQ-C30 quality of life scale before and after completing the diagnostic evaluation. The baseline and follow-up EORTC-QLQ-C30 scores were compared with reference populations. The impact of socio-demographic and medical factors on HRQoL at follow-up was explored by bootstrapped multivariate linear regression.



Results
A total of 838 patients participated in the study; 680 (81%) also completed follow-up. Twenty-two percent of the patients received a cancer diagnosis at the end of follow-up. Patients presented initially with a high burden of symptoms, less role and emotional functioning and a lower global health/QoL. Most domains improved after diagnosis and no clinically important difference between baseline and follow-up scores was found. Patients reported effects on HRQoL both at baseline and at follow-up compared with the Danish reference population and had similar scores as a cancer reference population. Co-morbidity, being unemployed and receiving a cancer diagnosis had the greatest effect on HRQoL around the time of diagnosis.

Aim
We aimed to identify and evaluate the quality and evidence of the motor learning literature about intervention studies regarding the contextual interference (CI) effect (blocked vs. random practice order) in children with brain lesions and typically developing (TD) children.



Method
Eight databases (Cinahl, Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, Pedro, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Knowledge) were searched systematically with predefined search terms. Controlled studies examining the CI effect in children (with brain lesions or TD) were included. Evidence level, conduct quality, and risk of bias were evaluated by two authors independently. A best evidence synthesis was performed.



Results
Twenty-five papers evaluating TD children were included. One of these studies also assessed children with cerebral palsy. Evidence levels were I, II, or III. Conduct quality was low and the risk of bias high, due to methodological issues in the study designs or poor description thereof. Best evidence synthesis showed mainly no or conflicting evidence. Single tasks showed limited to moderate evidence supporting the CI effect in TD children.



Conclusion
There is a severe limitation of good-quality evidence about the CI effect in children who practice different tasks in one session, especially in children with brain lesions.",12,"['were searched', 'were included', 'were evaluated', 'was performed', 'were included']",5,5,0.4166666666666667,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0209979,The role of the practice order: A systematic review about contextual interference in children

Aim
We aimed to identify specific polymorphisms of genes encoding for vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), renin-angiotensin system (angiotensinogen gene [AGT], angiotensinogen type 1 receptor [AGTR1], angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE]), and heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX-1) in a cohort of preterm infants and correlate their presence with the development of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) requiring mechanical ventilation (MV), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).



Study Design
We carried out a retrospective study to evaluate the allele frequency and genotype distribution of polymorphisms of VEGFA, eNOS, AGT, AGTR1, ACE, and HMOX-1 in a population of preterm neonates (n=342) with a gestational age ≤28 weeks according to the presence or absence of RDS requiring MV, BPD, IVH, or ROP. Moreover, we evaluated through the haplotype reconstruction analysis whether combinations of the selected polymorphisms are related to the occurrence of RDS, BPD, IVH and ROP.



Results
In our population 157 infants developed RDS requiring MV, 71 BPD, 70 IVH, and 43 ROP. We found that TC+CC rs2070744 eNOS (41.7 vs. 25.4%, p=0.01) and GT+TT rs1799983 eNOS (51.8 vs. 35.2%, p=0.01) polymorphisms are independent risk factors for BPD. Haplotype reconstruction showed that haplotypes in VEGF and eNOS are significantly associated with different effects on RDS, BPD, IVH, and ROP in our population.



Conclusions
We found that TC+CC rs2070744 eNOS and GT+TT rs1799983 eNOS polymorphisms are independent predictors of an increased risk of developing BPD. Haplotypes of VEGFA and eNOS may be independent protective or risk markers for prematurity complications.",9,['are related'],1,1,0.1111111111111111,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131741,Genetic Contributions to the Development of Complications in Preterm Newborns

Aim
We examined whether glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is associated to carotid atherosclerosis in an elderly Korean population with normal fasting glucose.



Methods
Using data from the Korean Urban Rural Elderly study, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 1,133 participants (335 men and 798 women) with a mean age of 71.8 years. All participants had fasting blood glucose less than 100mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and HbA1c level below 6.5% (48 mmol/mol). They were also free from a history of cardiovascular disease, known type 2 diabetes mellitus or use of anti-diabetes medications. Carotid atherosclerosis was assessed by intima-media thickness (IMT) using ultrasonography. The association between HbA1c and carotid IMT was investigated using multivariable linear regression analysis.



Results
HbA1c levels were independently and positively associated with carotid IMT (β = 0.020, p = 0.045) after adjusting for sex, age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, smoking and alcohol intake. However, fasting insulin and glucose levels were not associated with carotid IMT.



Conclusion
HbA1c levels were positively associated with carotid atherosclerosis, as assessed by carotid IMT, in an elderly population with normoglycemia. Our study suggested that higher HbA1c level is an effective and informative marker of carotid atherosclerosis in an elderly population.",10,"['was assessed', 'was investigated', 'assessed by carotid imt, in an elderly population with normoglycemia']",3,3,0.3,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171761,Association between HbA1c and carotid atherosclerosis among elderly Koreans with normal fasting glucose

Aim
We explored the quality of life of adults with cerebral palsy without an intellectual disability and the predictors of quality of life.



Background
Because cerebral palsy is a disease that manifests in childhood, much of the research into quality of life for those dealing with it focuses on children; there are few studies that evaluate the quality of life of adults with cerebral palsy. Therefore, it is important to consider their perceptions in order to improve their general wellbeing and self-determination.



Design
This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study.



Method
Quality of life was measured using the GENCAT Quality of Life Scale. Demographic and personal variables were also collected and examined. Participants comprised 75 adults (58.7 percent men, mean age = 40.84 years) with cerebral palsy who were members of the National Cerebral Palsy Association of Spain between 2014 and 2015. A linear multivariate model was examined as well.



Results
The overall mean score indicator of participants’ quality of life was 103.29, which corresponds to the 56.6th percentile on the GENCAT scale. Examining the level of qualification, we found significant differences in the factors “personal development” and “self-determination,” and those with a university education obtained higher scores than their less-educated counterparts. Having a partner was related to higher quality of life standard scores. After constructing a linear model, it was observed that maintaining sexual relationships was another factor that increased participants’ quality of life.



Conclusion
This study highlights the importance of social and romantic relationships to achieve a better quality of life in adults with cerebral palsy who do not have an intellectual disability. Social integration and sexuality education programs should be developed to improve their quality of life.",13,"['was measured', 'were also collected and examined.', 'was examined', 'was related', 'was observed', 'should be developed']",6,6,0.46153846153846156,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0191960,Quality of life as assessed by adults with cerebral palsy

Aim
We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to determine the association between P2X7 -762T/C polymorphism and pulmonary tuberculosis susceptibility.



Methodology
Based on comprehensive searches of the PubMed, SCI, Elsevier, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang Database, we identified eligible studies about the association between P2X7 -762T/C polymorphism and pulmonary tuberculosis risk. Pooled odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated in random-effects model.



Results
A total of 2207 tuberculosis cases and 2220 controls in 8 case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. Allele model (C vs. T: p = 0.15; OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.65–1.07), homozygous model (CC vs. TT: p = 0.23; OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.44 to 1.22), and heterozygous model (CT vs. TT: p = 0.57; OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.68 to 1.24) did not show increased risk of developing pulmonary tuberculosis. Similarly, dominant model (CC+CT vs. TT: p = 0.32; OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.59 to 1.19) and recessive model (CC vs. CT+TT: p = 0.08; OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.04) failed to show increased risk of developing pulmonary tuberculosis.

Aim and Background
Herpes zoster is a viral disease caused by the reactivation of varicella–zoster virus (VZV) which remained latent in the cranial nerve or dorsal root ganglia. Cell-mediated immunity is known to decline with age as part of immunosenescence and can lead to the reactivation of VZV. Whereas herpes zoster is usually mild in healthy young persons, older patients are at increased risk for complications. In the present study we investigated the serum cytokine profile (IL-17, IL-23, IL-21, IL-4, IL-12), representing cellular and humoral immunity and assessed the level of VZV IgG antibodies in patients with herpes zoster.



Methods
We investigated the serum concentrations of IL-17, IL-23, IL-21, IL-4, IL-12 and the level of VZV IgG antibodies in 23 patients with herpes zoster who did not develop superinfection. The control group was represented by 21 individuals in similar age with no inflammatory and infectious diseases. Cytokine and antibodies levels were measured by ELISA method. Statistical analysis was performed using the ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic), t-test, Welch’s t-test, and nonparametric tests with STATISTICA 10 software.



Results
In patients with herpes zoster, the serum level of IL-17, IL-23, IL-21, IL-4 and IL-12 as well as VZV IgG antibodies titer were statistically significantly increased compared to control group.

Aims
(1) To model the process of use and usability of pH strips (2) to identify, through simulation studies, the likelihood of misreading pH strips, and to assess professional’s acceptance, trust and perceived usability of pH strips.



Methods
This study was undertaken in four phases and used a mixed method approach (an audit, a semi-structured interview, a survey and simulation study). The three months audit was of 24 patients, the semi-structured interview was performed with 19 health professionals and informed the process of use of pH strips. A survey of 134 professionals and novices explored the likelihood of misinterpreting pH strips. Standardised questionnaires were used to assess professionals perceived usability, trust and acceptance of pH strip use in a simulated study.



Results
The audit found that in 45.7% of the cases aspiration could not be achieved, and that 54% of the NG-tube insertions required x-ray confirmation. None of those interviewed had received formal training on pH strips use. In the simulated study, participants made up to 11.15% errors in reading the strips with important implications for decision making regarding NG tube placement. No difference was identified between professionals and novices in their likelihood of misinterpreting the pH value of the strips. Whilst the overall experience of usage is poor (47.3%), health professionals gave a positive level of trust in both the interview (62.6%) and the survey (68.7%) and acceptance (interview group 65.1%, survey group 74.7%). They also reported anxiety in the use of strips (interview group 29.7%, survey group 49.7%).



Conclusions
Significant errors occur when using pH strips in a simulated study.

Aims
A disturbance of the brain-gut axis is a prominent feature in functional bowel disorders (such as irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia) and psychological abnormalities are often implicated in their pathogenesis. We hypothesized that psychological morbidity in these conditions may result from gastrointestinal problems, rather than causing them.



Methods
Functional dyspepsia was induced by neonatal gastric irritation in male rats. 10-day old male Sprague-Dawley rats received 0.1% iodoacetamide (IA) or vehicle by oral gavage for 6 days. At 8–10 weeks of age, rats were tested with sucrose preference and forced-swimming tests to examine depression-like behavior. Elevated plus maze, open field and light-dark box tests were used to test anxiety-like behaviors. ACTH and corticosterone responses to a minor stressor, saline injection, and hypothalamic CRF expression were also measured.



Results
Behavioral tests revealed changes of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in IA-treated, but not control rats. As compared with controls, hypothalamic and amygdaloid CRF immunoreactivity, basal levels of plasma corticosterone and stress-induced ACTH were significantly higher in IA-treated rats. Gastric sensory ablation with resiniferatoxin had no effect on behaviors but treatment with CRF type 1 receptor antagonist, antalarmin, reversed the depression-like behavior in IA-treated rats



Conclusions
The present results suggest that transient gastric irritation in the neonatal period can induce a long lasting increase in depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, increased expression of CRF in the hypothalamus, and an increased sensitivity of HPA axis to stress. The depression-like behavior may be mediated by the CRF1 receptor. These findings have significant implications for the pathogenesis of psychological co-morbidity in patients with functional bowel disorders.",12,"['are often implicated', 'was induced', 'were tested', 'were used', 'were also measured', 'may be mediated']",6,6,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019498,"Transient Gastric Irritation in the Neonatal Rats Leads to Changes in Hypothalamic CRF Expression, Depression- and Anxiety-Like Behavior as Adults"

Aims
A very low calorie diet improves the metabolic regulation of obesity related type 2 diabetes, but not for all patients, which leads to frustration in patients and professionals alike. The aim of this study was to develop a prediction model of diet-induced weight loss in type 2 diabetes.



Methods
192 patients with type 2 diabetes and BMI>27 kg/m2 from the outpatient diabetes clinic of the Erasmus Medical Center underwent an 8-week very low calorie diet. Baseline demographic, psychological and physiological parameters were measured and the C-index was calculated of the model with the largest explained variance of relative weight loss using backward linear regression analysis. The model was internally validated using bootstrapping techniques.



Results
Weight loss after the diet was 7.8±4.6 kg (95%CI 7.2–8.5; p<0.001) and was independently associated with the baseline variables fasting glucose (B = -0.33 (95%CI -0.49, -0.18), p = 0.001), anxiety (HADS; B = -0.22 (95%CI -0.34, -0.11), p = 0.001), numb feeling in extremities (B = 1.86 (95%CI 0.85, 2.87), p = 0.002), insulin dose (B = 0.01 (95%CI 0.00, 0.02), p = 0.014) and waist-to-hip ratio (B = 6.79 (95%CI 2.10, 11.78), p = 0.003). This model explained 25% of the variance in weight loss. The C-index of this model to predict successful (≥5%) weight loss was 0.74 (95%CI 0.67–0.82), with a sensitivity of 0.93 (95% CI 0.89–0.97) and specificity of 0.29 (95% CI 0.16–0.42). When only the obese T2D patients (BMI≥30 kg/m2; n = 181) were considered, age also contributed to the model (B = 0.06 (95%CI 0.02, 0.11), p = 0.008), whereas waist-to-hip ratio did not.



Conclusions
Diet-induced weight loss in overweight adults with T2D was predicted by five baseline parameters, which were predominantly diabetes related. However, failure seems difficult to predict. We propose to test this prediction model in future prospective diet intervention studies in patients with type 2 diabetes.",12,"['were measured', 'was calculated', 'was internally validated', 'were considered', 'was predicted']",5,4,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160774,Predictors of Diet-Induced Weight Loss in Overweight Adults with Type 2 Diabetes
"Abstract

Aims
Abnormal physiological stress reactivity is increasingly investigated as a vulnerability marker for various physical and psychological health problems. However, studies are inconsistent in taking into account potential covariates that may influence the developing stress system. We systematically tested determinants (individual, developmental, environmental and substance use-related) of physiological and perceived physiological stress reactivity. We also examined the relation between physiological and perceived physiological stress reactivity.



Method
In a stratified sample of 363 children (7–12 years) and 344 adolescents (13–20 years) from the general population, we examined cortisol, heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia and perceived physiological stress reactivity to a psychosocial stress procedure.



Results
Using multivariate linear regression models, we found that individual, developmental, environmental and substance use-related factors were related to each of the stress response indices. These determinant factors were different for each of the stress reactivity indices, and different in children versus adolescents. Perceived physiological stress reactivity predicted cortisol reactivity in adolescents only. All other relations between perceived physiological and physiological stress reactivity were not significant.



Conclusions
As physiological stress variables are often examined as vulnerability markers for the development of health problems, we maintain that it is essential that future studies take into consideration factors that may account for found relations. Our study provides an overview and indication of which variables should be considered in the investigation of the relation between physiological stress indices and illness.",11,"['is increasingly investigated', 'were related', 'are often examined', 'should be considered']",4,4,0.36363636363636365,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0061724,Determinants of Physiological and Perceived Physiological Stress Reactivity in Children and Adolescents

Aims
Abuse of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) is highly prevalent among male recreational athletes. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of AAS abuse on reproductive hormone levels and symptoms suggestive of hypogonadism in current and former AAS abusers.



Methods
This study had a cross-sectional case-control design and involved 37 current AAS abusers, 33 former AAS abusers (mean (95%CI) elapsed duration since AAS cessation: 2.5 (1.7; 3.7) years) and 30 healthy control participants. All participants were aged 18–50 years and were involved in recreational strength training. Reproductive hormones (FSH, LH, testosterone, inhibin B and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)) were measured using morning blood samples. Symptoms of hypogonadism (depressive symptoms, fatigue, decreased libido and erectile dysfunction) were recorded systematically.



Results
Former AAS abusers exhibited significantly lower median (25th –75th percentiles) total and free testosterone levels than control participants (total testosterone: 14.4 (11.9–17.7) nmol/l vs. 18.8 (16.6–22.0) nmol/l) (P < 0.01). Overall, 27.2% (13.3; 45.5) of former AAS abusers exhibited plasma total testosterone levels below the lower reference limit (12.1 nmol/l) whereas no control participants exhibited testosterone below this limit (P < 0.01). Gonadotropins were significantly suppressed, and inhibin B and AMH were significantly decreased in current AAS abusers compared with former AAS abusers and control participants (P < 0.01). The group of former AAS abusers had higher proportions of participants with depressive symptoms ((24.2%) (11.1; 42.2)), erectile dysfunction ((27.3%) (13.3; 45.6)) and decreased libido ((40.1%) (23.2; 57.0)) than the other two groups (trend analyses: P < 0.05).



Conclusions
Former AAS abusers exhibited significantly lower plasma testosterone levels and higher frequencies of symptoms suggestive of hypogonadism than healthy control participants years after AAS cessation. Current AAS abusers exhibited severely decreased AMH and inhibin B indicative of impaired spermatogenesis.",12,"['were aged', 'were measured', 'were recorded', 'were significantly suppressed', 'were significantly decreased']",5,4,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161208,Former Abusers of Anabolic Androgenic Steroids Exhibit Decreased Testosterone Levels and Hypogonadal Symptoms Years after Cessation: A Case-Control Study
"Abstract

Aims
Adolescent girls with diabetes are at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes due to age, risk-taking behavior, poor glycemic control, and lack of knowledge. Our aims were to assess attitudes and behaviors related to reproductive health education (RHE) among diabetes healthcare providers and adolescent girls with diabetes, and to pilot a brief clinic-based RHE intervention.



Methods
We surveyed 29 providers and 50 adolescent girls with type 1 diabetes about RHE experiences, attitudes, and behaviors. We piloted the RHE intervention with 9 adolescent-parent dyads.



Results
50% of providers were very uncomfortable discussing pregnancy or contraception. Most (72%) did not proactively initiate RHE; common barriers included insufficient time and subject knowledge. Fewer than 10% recommended long-acting reversible contraceptives. A minority (10%) of adolescents had discussed pregnancy or contraception with a provider. RHE sessions lasted a median of 16 (range 13–24) minutes, and there were promising trends for changes in adolescents’ self-efficacy and intentions to use contraception and seek preconception counseling and in their knowledge of reproductive health.



Conclusion
Adolescent girls with diabetes rarely receive education on pregnancy and contraception due to provider discomfort, limited knowledge, and limited time. RHE using easily-accessible materials with an educator may help address this gap in care.",11,[],0,0,0.0,0,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0206102,Identifying and addressing gaps in reproductive health education for adolescent girls with type 1 diabetes

Aims
Alcohol use is associated with both positive and negative effects on individual cardiovascular risk factors, depending upon which risk factor is assessed. The present analysis uses a summative multisystem index of biologic risk, known as allostatic load (AL), to evaluate whether the overall balance of alcohol-associated positive and negative cardiovascular risk factors may be favorable or unfavorable.



Methods
This analysis included 1255 adults from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) biomarker substudy. Participants, average age 54.5 (±11) years, were divided into 6 alcohol-use categories based on self-reported drinking habits. Current non-drinkers were classified as lifelong abstainers and former light drinkers, former moderate drinkers, or former heavy drinkers. Current alcohol users were classified as light, moderate, or heavy drinkers. A total AL score was calculated using 24 biomarkers grouped into 7 physiologic systems including cardiovascular, inflammation, glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Mixed-effects regression models were fit to determine the relationship between alcohol use categories and AL with controls for covariates that may influence the relationship between alcohol use and AL.



Results
468 (37.6%) individuals were current non-drinkers while 776 (62.4%) were current drinkers. In adjusted mixed-effects regression models, all 3 groups of current drinkers had significantly lower average AL scores than the lifelong abstainer/former light drinker group (light: -0.23, 95% CI -0.40, -0.07, p < 0.01; moderate: -0.20, 95% CI -0.38, -0.02, p < 0.05; heavy: -0.30, 95% CI -0.57, -0.04, p < 0.05), while the average AL scores of former moderate and former heavy drinkers did not differ from the lifelong abstainer/former light drinker group.



Conclusions
Current alcohol use is associated cross-sectionally with a favorable multisystem physiologic score known to be associated with better long-term health outcomes, providing evidence in support of long-term health benefits related to alcohol consumption.",11,"['is assessed', 'were divided', 'were classified', 'were classified', 'was calculated']",5,5,0.45454545454545453,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223168,"Compared to non-drinkers, individuals who drink alcohol have a more favorable multisystem physiologic risk score as measured by allostatic load"
"Abstract

Aims
Autonomic, cognitive, and neuropsychologic deficits appear in heart failure (HF) subjects, and these compromised functions depend on cerebral cortex integrity in addition to that of subcortical and brainstem sites. Impaired autoregulation, low cardiac output, sleep-disordered-breathing, hypertension, and diabetic conditions in HF offer considerable potential to affect cortical areas by loss of neurons and glia, which would be expressed as reduced cortical thicknesses. However, except for gross descriptions of cortical volume loss/injury, regional cortical thickness integrity in HF is unknown. Our goal was to assess regional cortical thicknesses across the brain in HF, compared to control subjects.



Methods and Results
We examined localized cortical thicknesses in 35 HF and 61 control subjects with high-resolution T1-weighted images (3.0-Tesla MRI) using FreeSurfer software, and assessed group differences with analysis-of-covariance (covariates; age, gender; p<0.05; FDR). Significantly-reduced cortical thicknesses appeared in HF over controls in multiple areas, including the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes, more markedly on the left side, within areas that control autonomic, cognitive, affective, language, and visual functions.



Conclusion
Heart failure subjects show reduced regional cortical thicknesses in sites that control autonomic, cognitive, affective, language, and visual functions that are deficient in the condition. The findings suggest chronic tissue alterations, with regional changes reflecting loss of neurons and glia, and presumably are related to earlier-described axonal changes. The pathological mechanisms contributing to reduced cortical thicknesses likely include hypoxia/ischemia, accompanying impaired cerebral perfusion from reduced cardiac output and sleep-disordered-breathing and other comorbidities in HF.",9,"['would be expressed', 'are related']",2,2,0.2222222222222222,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0126595,Reduced Regional Brain Cortical Thickness in Patients with Heart Failure
"Abstract

Aims
Baseline HbA1c is a major predictor of response to glucose lowering therapy and therefore a potential confounder in studies aiming to identify other predictors. However, baseline adjustment may introduce error if the association between baseline HbA1c and response is substantially due to measurement error and regression to the mean. We aimed to determine whether studies of predictors of response should adjust for baseline HbA1c.



Methods
We assessed the relationship between baseline HbA1c and glycaemic response in 257 participants treated with GLP-1R agonists and assessed whether it reflected measurement error and regression to the mean using duplicate ‘pre-baseline’ HbA1c measurements not included in the response variable. In this cohort and an additional 2659 participants treated with sulfonylureas we assessed the relationship between covariates associated with baseline HbA1c and treatment response with and without baseline adjustment, and with a bias correction using pre-baseline HbA1c to adjust for the effects of error in baseline HbA1c.



Results
Baseline HbA1c was a major predictor of response (R2 = 0.19,β = -0.44,p<0.001).The association between pre-baseline and response was similar suggesting the greater response at higher baseline HbA1cs is not mainly due to measurement error and subsequent regression to the mean. In unadjusted analysis in both cohorts, factors associated with baseline HbA1c were associated with response, however these associations were weak or absent after adjustment for baseline HbA1c. Bias correction did not substantially alter associations.



Conclusions
Adjustment for the baseline HbA1c measurement is a simple and effective way to reduce bias in studies of predictors of response to glucose lowering therapy.",9,[],0,0,0.0,0,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152428,Should Studies of Diabetes Treatment Stratification Correct for Baseline HbA1c?

Aims
Biomarkers have shown promising results in risk assessment of cardiovascular events. Their role in predicting the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is not well established. We tested the performance of several biomarkers in risk assessment for SCD in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and preserved left ventricular function.



Methods and results
The study population consisted of 1,946 CAD patients (68% male; mean age 66.9±8.6 yrs; type 2 diabetes (T2D) 43%) enrolled in the ARTEMIS study. The study subjects underwent examinations with echocardiography and measurement of several biomarkers. The primary endpoint of the study was SCD. During the mean follow up of 76±20 months 50 patients experienced SCD. Elevated high sensitive CRP (hs-CRP, p = 0.001), soluble ST2 (sST2, p<0.001), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP, p<0.001), and highly sensitive TroponinT (hs-TnT, p<0.001) predicted the occurrence of SCD in univariate analysis. Using the optimal cutoff points, elevated sST2 (≥27.45ng/mL; hazard ratio [HR] 2.7; 95%CI 1.4–5.1, p = 0.003) and hs-TnT (≥15 ng/mL; HR 2.9; 95% CI 1.5–5.6, p = 0.002) were the strongest predictors of SCD followed by hs-CRP (HR 2.4; 95% CI 1.3–4.4, p = 0.004) and BNP (HR 1.9; 95% CI 1.0–3.7, p = 0.046) in adjusted analysis. Combination of elevated hs-TnT and sST2 resulted in adjusted HR of 6.4 (95% CI 2.6–15.5, p<0.001).



Conclusion
Elevated sST2 and hs-TnT predict the occurrence of SCD among patients with CAD and preserved left ventricular function. The association between sST2, hs-TnT and SCD may be explained by an ongoing myocardial apoptosis followed by fibrosis leading to vulnerability to malignant arrhythmias.",12,['may be explained'],1,1,0.08333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0203363,Biomarkers as predictors of sudden cardiac death in coronary artery disease patients with preserved left ventricular function (ARTEMIS study)
"Abstract

Aims
Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia type 1 (CPVT1) predisposes to ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs) during high heart rates due to physical or psychological stress. The essential role of catecholaminergic effects on ventricular cardiomyocytes in this situation is well documented, but the importance of heart rate per se for arrhythmia initiation in CPVT1 is largely unexplored.



Methods and results
Sixteen CPVT1 patients performed a bicycle stress-test. Occurrence of VT triggers, i.e. premature ventricular complexes (PVC), depended on high heart rate, with individual thresholds. Atrial pacing above the individual PVC threshold in three patients did not induce PVCs.
The underlying mechanism for the clinical observation was explored using cardiomyocytes from mice with the RyR2-R2474S (RyR2-RS) mutation, which exhibit exercise-induced VTs. While rapid pacing increased the number of Ca2+ waves in both RyR2-RS and wild-type (p<0.05), β-adrenoceptor (βAR) stimulation induced more Ca2+ waves in RyR2-RS (p<0.05). Notably, Ca2+ waves occurred despite decreased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ content in RyR2-RS (p<0.05), suggesting increased cytosolic RyR2 Ca2+ sensitivity.
A computational model of mouse ventricular cardiomyocyte electrophysiology reproduced the cellular CPVT1 phenotype when RyR2 Ca2+ sensitivity was increased. Importantly, diastolic fluctuations in phosphorylation of RyR2 and SR Ca2+ content determined Ca2+ wave initiation. These factors were modulated towards increased propensity for arrhythmia initiation by increased pacing rates, but even more by βAR stimulation.



Conclusion
In CPVT1, VT propensity depends on individual heart rate thresholds for PVCs. Through converging data from clinical exercise stress-testing, cellular studies and computational modelling, we confirm the heart rate-independent pro-arrhythmic effects of βAR stimulation in CPVT1, but also identify an independent and synergistic contribution from effects of high heart rate.",12,"['is well documented', 'was explored', 'was increased', 'were modulated']",4,4,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207100,Arrhythmia initiation in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia type 1 depends on both heart rate and sympathetic stimulation

Aims
Cross-sectional studies demonstrated associations of several sociodemographic and psychosocial factors with generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children and adolescents. However, little is known about factors affecting the change in child and adolescent HRQoL over time. This study investigates potential psychosocial risk and protective factors of child and adolescent HRQoL based on longitudinal data of a German population-based study.



Methods
Data from the BELLA study gathered at three measurement points (baseline, 1-year and 2-year follow-ups) were investigated in n = 1,554 children and adolescents aged 11 to 17 years at baseline. Self-reported HRQoL was assessed by the KIDSCREEN-10 Index. We examined effects of sociodemographic factors, mental health problems, parental mental health problems, as well as potential personal, familial, and social protective factors on child and adolescent HRQoL at baseline as well as over time using longitudinal growth modeling.



Results
At baseline, girls reported lower HRQoL than boys, especially in older participants; low socioeconomic status and migration background were both associated with low HRQoL. Mental health problems as well as parental mental health problems were negatively, self-efficacy, family climate, and social support were positively associated with initial HRQoL. Longitudinal analyses revealed less increase of HRQoL in girls than boys, especially in younger participants. Changes in mental health problems were negatively, changes in self-efficacy and social support were positively associated with the change in HRQoL over time. No effects were found for changes in parental mental health problems or in family climate on changes in HRQoL. Moderating effects for self-efficacy, family climate or social support on the relationships between the investigated risk factors and HRQoL were not found.



Conclusion
The risk factor mental health problems negatively and the resource factors self-efficacy and social support positively affect the development of HRQoL in young people, and should be considered in prevention programs.",13,"['is known', 'were investigated', 'was assessed', 'were found', 'were not found', 'should be considered']",6,6,0.46153846153846156,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0190363,Risk and protective factors of health-related quality of life in children and adolescents: Results of the longitudinal BELLA study

Aims
Deprescribing is the process of reducing or discontinuing medicines that are unnecessary or deemed to be harmful. We aimed to investigate general practitioner (GP) perceived challenges to deprescribing in residential care and the possible enablers that support GPs to implement deprescribing.



Methods
A qualitative study was undertaken using semi-structured, face-to-face interviews from two cities in New Zealand and a purpose-developed pilot-tested interview schedule. Interviews were recorded with permission and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were read and re-read and themes were identified with iterative building of a coding list until all data was accounted for. Interviews continued until saturation of ideas occurred. Analysis was carried out with the assistance of a Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and constant comparison techniques. Several themes were identified. Challenges and enablers of deprescribing were determined based on participants’ answers.



Results
Ten GPs agreed to participate. Four themes were identified to define the issues around prescribing for older people, from the GPs’ perspectives. Theme 1, the ‘recognition of the problem’, discusses the difficulties involved with prescribing for older people. Theme 2 outlines the identified behaviour change factors relevant to the problem. Deprescribing challenges were drawn from these factors and summarised in Theme 3 under three major headings; ‘prescribing factors’, ‘social influences’ and ‘policy and processes’. Deprescribing enablers, based on the opinions and professional experience of GPs, were retrieved and summarised in Theme 4.



Conclusion
The process of deprescribing is laced with many challenges for GPs. The uncertainty of research evidence in older people and social factors such as specialists’ and nurses’ influences were among the major challenges identified. Deprescribing enablers encompassed support for GPs’ awareness and knowledge, improvement of communication between multiple prescribers, adequate reimbursement and pharmacists being involved in the multidisciplinary team.",18,"['was undertaken', 'were recorded', 'were read and re-', 'were identified', 'was accounted', 'was carried', 'were identified', 'were determined', 'were identified', 'were drawn', 'were retrieved and summarised in', 'is laced']",12,10,0.5555555555555556,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0151066,Challenges and Enablers of Deprescribing: A General Practitioner Perspective

Aims
Disturbed levels of thyroid hormones are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, including memory impairments. The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of mild induced thyrotoxicosis on working memory and its neural correlates.



Methods
Twenty-nine healthy, male subjects with normal thyroid state participated in the study. Functional MRI was acquired during a working memory task (n-back task) before and after ingesting 250 μg L-thyroxin per day for a period of eight weeks. In addition, neuropsychological tests were performed.



Results
In the hyperthyroid condition the subjects showed slower reaction times, but a higher accuracy in the 0-back version of the memory tasks. Fewer differences between euthyroid and hyperthyroid state were seen for the more difficult conditions of the n-back task. FMRI revealed effects of difficulty in the parahippocampal gyrus, supplementary motor area, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cerebellum, rolandic operculum and insula (p<0.05, FWE corrected). When comparing euthyroid and hyperthyroid condition in relation to task-induced activation, differences of activation were found in the right prefrontal cortex as well as in the right parahippocampal area. In the psychological assessment, the alerting effect in the Attention Network Task (ANT) and four out of five parameters of the auditory verbal learning test (AVLT) showed an increase from euthyroid to hyperthyroid state.



Conclusions
It can be concluded that even a short-term intake of thyroid hormones leads to an activation of brain areas associated with working memory and to an improvement of accuracy of working memory tasks.",12,"['was acquired', 'were performed', 'were seen', 'were found', 'can be concluded']",5,5,0.4166666666666667,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161552,Effect of Mild Thyrotoxicosis on Performance and Brain Activations in a Working Memory Task

Aims
Domestic dogs are trained to a wide variety of roles including an increasing number of medical assistance tasks. Glycaemia alert dogs are reported to greatly improve the quality of life of owners living with Type 1 diabetes. Research into their value is currently sparse, on small numbers of dogs and provides conflicting results. In this study we assess the reliability of a large number of trained glycaemic alert dogs at responding to hypo- and hyper-glycaemic (referred to as out-of-range, OOR) episodes, and explore factors associated with variations in their performance.



Methods
Routine owner records were used to assess the sensitivity and specificity of each of 27 dogs, trained by a single UK charity during almost 4000 out-of-range episodes. Sensitivity and positive predictive values are compared to demographic factors and instructors’ ratings of the dog, owner and partnership.



Results
Dogs varied in their performance, with median sensitivity to out-of-range episodes at 70% (25th percentile = 50, 75th percentile = 95). To hypoglycaemic episodes the median sensitivity was 83% (66–94%) while to hyperglyaemic episodes it was 67% (17–91%). The median positive predictive value (PPV) was 81% (68–94%), i.e. on average 81% of alerts occurred when glucose levels were out of target range. For four dogs, PPV was 100%. Individual characteristics of the dog, the partnership and the household were significantly associated with performance (e.g., whether the dog was previously a pet, when it was trained, whether its partner was an adult or child).



Conclusions
The large sample shows that the individual performance of dogs is variable, but overall their sensitivity and specificity to OOR episodes are better than previous studies suggest. Results show that optimal performance of glycaemic alert dogs depends not only on good initial and ongoing training, but also careful selection of dogs for the conditions in which they will be working.",13,"['are trained', 'are reported', 'were used', 'are compared', 'was trained']",5,5,0.38461538461538464,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210092,How effective are trained dogs at alerting their owners to changes in blood glycaemic levels?: Variations in performance of glycaemia alert dogs
"Abstract

Aims
Epidemiological surveys over the last 20 years show a steady increase in the amount of alcohol consumed by older age groups. Physiological changes and an increased likelihood of health problems and medication use make older people more likely than younger age groups to suffer negative consequences of alcohol consumption, often at lower levels. However, health services targeting excessive drinking tend to be aimed at younger age groups. The aim of this study was to gain an in-depth understanding of experiences of, and attitudes towards, support for alcohol related health issues in people aged 50 and over.



Methods
Qualitative interviews (n = 24, 12 male/12 female, ages 51–90 years) and focus groups (n = 27, 6 male/21 female, ages 50–95 years) were carried out with a purposive sample of participants who consumed alcohol or had been dependent.



Findings
Participants’ alcohol misuse was often covert, isolated and carefully regulated. Participants tended to look first to their General Practitioner for help with alcohol. Detoxification courses had been found effective for dependent participants but only in the short term; rehabilitation facilities were appreciated but seen as difficult to access. Activities, informal groups and drop-in centres were endorsed. It was seen as difficult to secure treatment for alcohol and mental health problems together. Barriers to seeking help included functioning at a high level, concern about losing positive aspects of drinking, perceived stigma, service orientation to younger people, and fatalistic attitudes to help-seeking. Facilitators included concern about risk of fatal illness or pressure from significant people.



Conclusion
Primary care professionals need training on improving the detection and treatment of alcohol problems among older people. There is also a compelling need to ensure that aftercare is in place to prevent relapse. Strong preferences were expressed for support to be provided by those who had experienced alcohol problems themselves.",15,"['be aimed', 'were carried', 'had been found', 'were appreciated', 'were endorsed', 'was seen', 'were expressed', 'provided by those']",8,6,0.4,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0148601,A Qualitative Study of Service Provision for Alcohol Related Health Issues in Mid to Later Life

Aims
Estimate the prevalence of cannabis dependence and its contribution to the global burden of disease.



Methods
Systematic reviews of epidemiological data on cannabis dependence (1990-2008) were conducted in line with PRISMA and meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Culling and data extraction followed protocols, with cross-checking and consistency checks. DisMod-MR, the latest version of generic disease modelling system, redesigned as a Bayesian meta-regression tool, imputed prevalence by age, year and sex for 187 countries and 21 regions. The disability weight associated with cannabis dependence was estimated through population surveys and multiplied by prevalence data to calculate the years of life lived with disability (YLDs) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). YLDs and DALYs attributed to regular cannabis use as a risk factor for schizophrenia were also estimated.



Results
There were an estimated 13.1 million cannabis dependent people globally in 2010 (point prevalence0.19% (95% uncertainty: 0.17-0.21%)). Prevalence peaked between 20-24 yrs, was higher in males (0.23% (0.2-0.27%)) than females (0.14% (0.12-0.16%)) and in high income regions. Cannabis dependence accounted for 2 million DALYs globally (0.08%; 0.05-0.12%) in 2010; a 22% increase in crude DALYs since 1990 largely due to population growth. Countries with statistically higher age-standardised DALY rates included the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Western European countries such as the United Kingdom; those with lower DALY rates were from Sub-Saharan Africa-West and Latin America. Regular cannabis use as a risk factor for schizophrenia accounted for an estimated 7,000 DALYs globally.



Conclusion
Cannabis dependence is a disorder primarily experienced by young adults, especially in higher income countries. It has not been shown to increase mortality as opioid and other forms of illicit drug dependence do. Our estimates suggest that cannabis use as a risk factor for schizophrenia is not a major contributor to population-level disease burden.",13,"['were conducted', 'was estimated', 'were also estimated', 'disorder primarily experienced', 'been shown']",5,5,0.38461538461538464,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0076635,The Global Epidemiology and Contribution of Cannabis Use and Dependence to the Global Burden of Disease: Results from the GBD 2010 Study

Aims
In order to add to the existing knowledge about factors associated with retirement timing, in the car industry, it is useful to consider the psychosocial working conditions prior to retirement. This case-control study aimed to investigate relationships between psychosocial job factors and extended work after the age of 62 years among workers in the car industry in Sweden.



Methods
A study invitation with a survey was sent to workers in one of Sweden’s largest car manufacturing company, who were employed 2005–2015 and either retired at the age 55–62 years or working at 63 years or older. Psychosocial variables such as job demand-control (JDC) and effort-reward imbalance (ERI) were recorded through the survey. Multiple logistic regression models were used to investigate associations between psychosocial variables and retirement in 572 cases that had continued to work ≥ 63 years, and 771 controls who had retired at 62 or earlier.



Results
No associations were found between JDC-variables and retirement in the total sample or gender stratified analyses, but high demands-low control (high strain) was related to retirement before the age of 63 years in blue-collar workers. In contrast, high strain was related to continuing to work after 62 years for white-collar men and, high ERI was associated with extended work for the total sample of white-collar workers, and white-collar men, however these effects became non-significant in fully adjusted models.



Conclusions
The relationships between psychosocial factors and extended work after 62 years were inconsistent, with high strain being related to retiring earlier for blue-collar workers.",8,"['was sent', 'were employed', 'were recorded', 'were used', 'were found', 'was related', 'was related', 'being related']",8,6,0.75,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233009,"A sustainable working life in the car manufacturing industry: The role of psychosocial factors, gender and occupation"

Aims
Interindividual variability in telomere length is highly heritable. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) shortening has been shown to be associated with the process of atherosclerosis. But whether the inheritance of LTL is related to stroke is still unclear. The aim of this study was to test if telomere shortening was associated with stroke and whether this association was mainly due to inheritance or acquired cardiovascular risk factors.



Methods
Our study was focused on stroke in patients and their siblings. 450 subjects were recruited into this study: 150 patients with ischemic stroke as case group, 150 siblings of patients free of stroke (sibling group) and 150 healthy people as normal control. LTL was measured by real-time Polymerase Chain Reactions. The association between LTL and the cardiovascular risk factors was also determined.



Results
A significant decrease of LTL was found in case group when comparing with sibling (0.92±0.77 vs 1.68±1.24, p<0.001) and normal groups (0.92±0.77 vs 1.95±1.07, p<0.001), but no significant difference was found between sibling group and healthy control (p = 0.330). Shorter telomere length was independently associated with hypertension (p = 0.029, OR = 2.189, 95%CI:1.084–4.421), recent social pressure (p = 0.001, OR = 3.121, 95%CI:1.597–6.101), age (p = 0.004, OR = 1.055, 95%CI:1.017–1.093), HDL (p = 0.022, OR = 0.227, 95%CI:0.064–0.810) and diabetes (p = 0.018, OR = 3.174, 95%CI:1.221–8.252). Additionally, shortened length of telomere (p = 0.017, OR = 3.996, 95%CI:1.283–12.774) was an independent risk biomarker for stroke among case and sibling groups.



Conclusion
The present study has demonstrated that decreased LTL might be associated with ischemic stroke but unlikely to be causative.",12,"['has been shown', 'is related', 'was focused', 'were recruited', 'was measured', 'was also determined', 'was found', 'was found']",8,7,0.5833333333333334,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0068254,Decreased Leukocyte Telomere Length (LTL) Is Associated with Stroke but Unlikely to Be Causative

Aims
Investments to promote public transport utilisation are being championed to achieve sustainable development, but the potential co-benefits for mental health are comparatively under-researched. We hypothesised that frequent users of public transport would be more likely to have better mental health (possibly due to increased levels of physical activity), but among the more frequent users, less favourable perceptions of public transport infrastructure (PPTI) could have a negative influence on mental health.



Methods
Multilevel linear and logistic regressions were fitted on 30,214 participants in the UK Household Longitudinal Study with lagged PPTI and confounder measures at baseline and indicators of active travel and mental health (General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), SF-12 Mental Component Scale (MCS) and the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale (WEMWBS)) at follow-up.



Results
Compared to participants expressing poor PPTI, those who felt it was excellent were 1.29 (95%CI 1.15, 1.45) times more likely to be frequent users of public transport and 1.53 (95%CI 1.33, 1.76) times more likely to choose to walk or cycle journeys of less than two to three miles. Frequent use of public transport was found to be consistently associated with better mental health for GHQ caseness (OR 0.85, 95%CI 0.79, 0.91), GHQ score (coefficient -0.28, 95%CI -0.41, -0.16), MCS (coefficient 0.45, 95%CI 0.23, 0.66), and WEMWBS (coefficient 0.30, 95%CI 0.19, 0.40). Among frequent users of public transport, participants expressing poor PPTI were 1.46 (95%CI 1.11, 1.93) times more likely to report poorer mental health according to the GHQ caseness indicator, compared to frequent users that regarded PPTI as excellent. Similar results were observed for the other indicators of mental health.



Conclusions
These findings indicate that while the provision of public transport infrastructure is a necessary pre-condition for stimulating population increases in physical activity, PPTI improvements needs to be prioritised to leverage the full mental health-related co-benefits of active travel.",9,"['are being championed', 'were fitted', 'was found', 'were observed', 'be prioritised']",5,5,0.5555555555555556,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180081,Perceived public transport infrastructure modifies the association between public transport use and mental health: Multilevel analyses from the United Kingdom

Aims
It is perceived that patients with a history of frequent alcohol consumption require more opioids for postoperative pain control and experience less postoperative nausea and vomiting than patients without such a history. However, there is scarce evidence supporting this notion. The aim of this study was to assess association between frequent alcohol consumption and opioid requirement for postoperative pain control and occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting.



Methods
The medical records for 4143 patients using intravenous patient-control analgesia with opioids after abdominal surgery between January 2010 and September 2013 were obtained, and associations were sought between the cumulative opioid consumption (in intravenous morphine equivalence) per body weight (mg/kg) in the first 2 days after abdominal operation and several demographic and clinical variables by multiple regression analysis. The association between the occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and several demographic and clinical variables was also sought by multiple logistic regression analysis.



Results
Frequent alcohol drinking, among other previously reported factors, was associated with increased opioid consumption for postoperative pain control (p < 0.001). The estimate effect of frequent alcohol drinking was 0.117 mg/kg. Frequent alcohol drinking was also associated with decreased risks of postoperative nausea (odds ratio = 0.59, p = 0.003) and vomiting (odds ratio = 0.49, p = 0.026).



Conclusions
Frequent alcohol drinking was associated with increased opioid consumption for postoperative pain control and decreased risks of postoperative nausea and vomiting after abdominal surgery.",10,"['is perceived', 'were obtained', 'were sought', 'was also sought']",4,3,0.3,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171275,The association between frequent alcohol drinking and opioid consumption after abdominal surgery: A retrospective analysis

Aims
Japan and Korea are the world’s most aged and most rapidly aging nations. They both have low fertility rates, thereby intensifying the importance of social structures to aid a large, dependent population of older adults. Common strategies involve improving their social participation, which enhances their physical and mental health, so they are supporting society rather than being supported. Since the social participation rates in both countries are not as high as those of Western countries, it is critical to shed light on the factors related to social participation of the elderly.



Methods
A secondary analyses were performed using Japanese and Korean data from the 2012 East Asia Social Survey (EASS), which includes nationally representative samples through random sampling. The analyses only include data from those 65 and older (Japan: N = 683, Korea: N = 362).



Results
Social participation is classified into four types: 1) no affiliation; 2) inactive participation; 3) active recreational; and 4) active social. The Japanese respondents had a higher participation rate than Koreans, but more Japanese were inactive. Though the rates of active participations were similar in both countries. Multinomial logistic regressions were conducted to examine the related factors among the four types of social participation. Basic attributes (e.g., living alone) and other factors (e.g., network size) were included as independent variables. The results show that larger non-family networks were linked with increased social participation in both societies. Men were more vulnerable to engaging in no social activities and at a higher risk of social isolation in both countries. One difference between the two nations is that among the Japanese, people with higher social orientations engage in more active social type participation.



Conclusion
This study reveals that non-kin social networks are important for social participation in Japan and Korea.",15,"['being supported', 'were performed', 'is classified', 'were conducted', 'were included', 'were linked']",6,6,0.4,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194703,Factors determining the social participation of older adults: A comparison between Japan and Korea using EASS 2012

Aims
Long-term urodynamics are required because bladder-emptying disorders are often not clearly revealed by conventional urodynamics. Patients with severe clinical overactive bladder symptoms, for instance, often show normal results. This may be due to the short evaluation time and psychological factors that complicate conventional urodynamics. This study aimed to develop an ambulatory three-component urodynamic measurement system that is easy to operate, registers urodynamic parameters for several days, and has no negative impact on the patient.



Methods
We developed an intravesical capsule combined with a hand-held device to register voiding desire and micturition, and an alarm pad device that detects urine loss. Recently, the intravesical capsule and its proven function were detailed in the literature. Here, we present detailed in vitro results using a female bladder model. The flexible capsule was C-shaped to minimize the risk of expulsion from the bladder during micturition. Results of biocompatibility evaluation of the intravesical capsule, which is called Wille Capsule (WiCa) are described.



Results
The WiCa with an oval nose and a maximum outer diameter of 5.5 mm was easily inserted through a 25-French cystoscope. Removing the WiCa by grasping the nose using the female model with bladder was easily conducted. Expulsion of the WiCa during voiding was avoided through a novel C-shaped device design. Based on in vitro cytotoxicity studies, the capsule is a promising and safe device.



Conclusion
Our novel system is an innovative minimally-invasive tool for accurate long-term urodynamic measurement, and does not require inserting a transurethral catheter.",11,"['are required', 'revealed by conventional urodynamics', 'were detailed', 'is called', 'are described', 'was easily inserted', 'was easily conducted', 'was avoided']",8,4,0.36363636363636365,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0096280,Catheterless Long-Term Ambulatory Urodynamic Measurement Using a Novel Three-Device System

Aims
Metabolic disturbances may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes. We investigated the relation between cognitive impairment and metabolic deteriorations, low physical fitness, low-grade inflammation and abdominal obesity in middle aged individuals.



Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study including 40 to 65 year-old patients with type 2 diabetes and limited co morbidity (N = 56), age-matched individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (N = 56) as well as age-matched controls with normal glucose tolerance (N = 72). Specific cognitive functions were assessed with focus on verbal memory, processing speed, executive functions, and a composite overall mean score. Oral glucose tolerance test, VO2max test, systemic inflammation, DXA scanning and abdominal MRI were measured.



Results
Multiple linear regression analyses adjusting for age, gender and verbal intelligence demonstrated that a low score in processing speed, executive functions and overall cognitive function were related to high fasting C-peptide, as well as low insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function and VO2max. Measurements of blood glucose, obesity and inflammation were not associated with cognitive function.



Conclusion
Low cognitive scores are seen in middle aged individuals with hyperinsulinemia, low insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function and low aerobic capacity. These findings emphasize the importance of appropriate lifestyle and not only blood glucose control in prevention of cognitive disability.",8,"['were assessed', 'were measured', 'were related', 'are seen']",4,4,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0051132,Cognitive Functions in Middle Aged Individuals Are Related to Metabolic Disturbances and Aerobic Capacity: A Cross-Sectional Study

Aims
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Circulating miRNAs were recently identified as biomarkers for various physiological and pathological conditions. In this study, we aimed to identify the circulating miRNA fingerprint of vulnerable coronary artery disease (CAD) and explore its potential as a novel biomarker for this disease.



Methods and Results
The Taqman low-density miRNA array and coexpression network analyses were used to identify distinct miRNA expression profiles in the plasma of patients with typical unstable angina (UA) and angiographically documented CAD (UA group, n = 13) compared to individuals with non-cardiac chest pain (control group, n = 13). Significantly elevated expression levels of miR-106b/25 cluster, miR-17/92a cluster, miR-21/590-5p family, miR-126*, and miR-451 were observed in UA patients compared to controls. These findings were validated by real-time PCR in another 45 UA patients, 31 stable angina patients, and 37 controls. In addition, miR-106b, miR-25, miR-92a, miR-21, miR-590-5p, miR-126* and miR-451 were upregulated in microparticles (MPs) isolated from the plasma of UA patients (n = 5) compared to controls (n = 5). Using flow cytometry and immunolabeling, we further found that Annexin V+ MPs were increased in the plasma samples of UA patients compared to controls, and the majority of the increased MPs in plasma were shown to be Annexin V+ CD31+ MPs. The findings suggest that Annexin V+ CD31+ MPs may contribute to the elevated expression of the selected miRNAs in the circulation of patients with vulnerable CAD.



Conclusion
The circulating miRNA signature, consisting of the miR-106b/25 cluster, miR-17/92a cluster, miR-21/590-5p family, miR-126* and miR-451, may be used as a novel biomarker for vulnerable CAD.

Aims
Most public health agencies and learned societies agree that the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test in asymptomatic men should not be recommended, on account of its potential for harm. Yet PSA is still widely used as a screening test and is not being abandoned. This remains a significant public health issue, and citizens’ engagement is needed. This study was designed to produce a deliberation on the PSA screening test by a citizens’ jury.



Methods
Fifteen citizens were selected and balanced for sex, age, and education. They received an information booklet and participated in a two-day meeting with experts to reach a deliberation on the question “Should the National Health Service discourage or recommend PSA as an individual screening test for prostate cancer in men 55–69 years old?”. A facilitator ran the jurors’ discussion.



Results
All except three of the jurors decided that the National Health Service should discourage the use of PSA as an individual screening test for prostate cancer in 55–69 year-old men. The jury was particularly convinced by the uncertainty of the test outcomes, the utility of the test, and its cost/benefit ratio. Before the meeting 60% of jurors would have recommended the test to a relative, and all the male jurors would have done so. After the meeting these percentages fell to 15% and 12%.



Conclusions
This experience confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of delegating to a group of citizens the responsibility to decide on public health issues on behalf of the community. Public health authorities should invest in information campaigns aimed at the public and in educational initiatives for physicians. This also provided an opportunity to disseminate information on screening, over-diagnosis, and over-treatment.",14,"['be recommended', 'is still widely used', 'being abandoned', 'is needed', 'was designed', 'were selected and balanced for', 'was particularly convinced']",7,6,0.42857142857142855,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0143176,Involving a Citizens’ Jury in Decisions on Individual Screening for Prostate Cancer

Aims
Non-Coeliac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS) is poorly understood, particularly in terms of its neurological outcomes. We initially conducted a prospective postal survey to investigate its neurological presentation and symptom course. Results from this then motivated a follow-up pilot study utilising brain MRI to characterise potential diagnostic biomarkers for future research.



Methods
Patients with NCGS were recruited from a specialist centre and completed a prospective postal questionnaire (N = 125). This summarised symptoms experienced, their severity and their course. Onset time was compared by Chi-squared analysis to data from the same centre concerning coeliac disease patients (N = 224). Five respondents on a strict gluten-free diet who self-reported brain fog then attended a pilot study, completing MR brain imaging/questionnaires before/after a gluten challenge. “Baseline” data were assessed for abnormalities, while symptom severity and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were compared before/after challenge.



Results
Survey participants were aged 47 (85% female). Prevalence of neurological symptoms were: headaches (51%), brain fog (48%), balance issues (31%), tingling (19%). Median symptom resolution time was 48 hours, while onset was 90 minutes; onset pattern was not significantly different compared to CD patients (p = 0.322). Extra-intestinal symptoms worsened by 37%(±28) during a typical reaction. Predominantly non-statistical observations from the brain imaging study are discussed.



Conclusions
Neurological symptoms in NCGS are common, and onset time is comparable to that in CD. Brain imaging may be a useful future means of investigating physiological injury and responses to gluten in further study.",14,"['is poorly understood', 'were recruited', 'was compared', 'were assessed', 'were compared', 'were aged', 'symptoms worsened', 'are discussed']",8,6,0.42857142857142855,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0238283,Brain fog and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity: Proof of concept brain MRI pilot study

Aims
Numerous healthcare decisions are faced by persons with advanced cancer from diagnosis to end-of-life. The family caregiver role in these decisions has focused on being a surrogate decision-maker, however, little is known about the caregiver’s role in supporting upstream patient decision-making. We aimed to describe the roles of family caregivers in assisting community-dwelling advanced cancer patients with healthcare decision-making across settings and contexts.



Methods
Qualitative study using one-on-one, semi-structured interviews with community-dwelling persons with metastatic cancer (n = 18) and their family caregivers (n = 20) recruited from outpatient oncology clinics of a large tertiary care academic medical center, between October 2016 and October 2017. Transcribed interviews were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach.



Findings
Caregivers averaged 56 years and were mostly female (95%), white (85%), and the patient’s partner/spouse (70%). Patients averaged 58 years and were mostly male (67%) in self-reported “fair” or “poor” health (50%) with genitourinary (33%), lung (17%), and hematologic (17%) cancers. Themes describing family member roles in supporting patients’ upstream healthcare decision-making were: 1) seeking information about the cancer, its trajectory, and treatments options; 2) ensuring family and healthcare clinicians have a common understanding of the patient’s treatment plan and condition; 3) facilitating discussions with patients about their values and the framing of their illness; 5) posing “what if” scenarios about current and potential future health states and treatments; 6) addressing collateral decisions (e.g., work arrangements) resulting from medical treatment choices; 6) originating healthcare-related decision points, including decisions about seeking emergency care; and 7) making healthcare decisions for patients who preferred to delegate healthcare decisions to their family caregivers.



Conclusions
These findings highlight a previously unreported and understudied set of critical decision partnering roles that cancer family caregivers play in patient healthcare decision-making. Optimizing these roles may represent novel targets for early decision support interventions for family caregivers.",9,"['are faced', 'is known', 'were analyzed']",3,3,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0212967,How family caregivers of persons with advanced cancer assist with upstream healthcare decision-making: A qualitative study

Aims
Oral language is the foundation of literacy. Naturally, policies and practices to promote children’s literacy begin in early childhood and have a strong focus on developing children’s oral language, especially for children with known risk factors for low language ability. The underlying assumption is that children’s progress along the oral to literate continuum is stable and predictable, such that low language ability foretells low literacy ability. This study investigated patterns and predictors of children’s oral language and literacy abilities at 4, 6, 8 and 10 years. The study sample comprised 2,316 to 2,792 children from the first nationally representative Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). Six developmental patterns were observed, a stable middle-high pattern, a stable low pattern, an improving pattern, a declining pattern, a fluctuating low pattern, and a fluctuating middle-high pattern. Most children (69%) fit a stable middle-high pattern. By contrast, less than 1% of children fit a stable low pattern. These results challenged the view that children’s progress along the oral to literate continuum is stable and predictable.



Findings
Multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate risks for low literacy ability at 10 years and sensitivity-specificity analysis was used to examine the predictive utility of the multivariate model. Predictors were modelled as risk variables with the lowest level of risk as the reference category. In the multivariate model, substantial risks for low literacy ability at 10 years, in order of descending magnitude, were: low school readiness, Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander status and low language ability at 8 years. Moderate risks were high temperamental reactivity, low language ability at 4 years, and low language ability at 6 years. The following risk factors were not statistically significant in the multivariate model: Low maternal consistency, low family income, health care card, child not read to at home, maternal smoking, maternal education, family structure, temperamental persistence, and socio-economic area disadvantage. The results of the sensitivity-specificity analysis showed that a well-fitted multivariate model featuring risks of substantive magnitude did not do particularly well in predicting low literacy ability at 10 years.",15,"['were observed', 'was used', 'was used', 'were modelled']",4,3,0.2,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0135612,Patterns and Predictors of Language and Literacy Abilities 4-10 Years in the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children
"Abstract

Aims
Our aim was to evaluate, in a second data analysis of the prospective randomized controlled trial conducted by Austrian Urogynaecology Working Group, the effect of age, BMI and parity at the time of surgery on short- and long-term outcomes of women primarily treated for SUI (stress urinary incontinence) with midurethral slings.



Methods
In the original study 554 patients received randomly a retropubic (TVT) or a transobturator midurethral (TVT-O) sling procedure. 480 (87%) and 277 (50%) patients were available for a follow-up efficacy evaluation at 3 months and 5 years respectively.



Results
Higher age and BMI at surgery appear to lead to a larger probability to have a positive stress test 5 years after surgery, but not after 3 months. Older patients seem to have a worse perception of improvement 5 years after surgery as compared to younger ones, as described by the PGI-I score. Age and BMI do not affect significantly the quality of life of women surgically treated for SUI, as reflected by the results of King´s Health Questionnaire. Parity does not seem to have any effect on objective and subjective surgical outcomes.



Conclusions
Higher age and BMI at surgery have a detrimental influence on the objective cure rate at 5 years after midurethral sling surgery; higher age also has a negative influence on subjective long-term outcomes. However, these demographic parameters do not influence significantly the quality of life of patients after anti-incontinence surgery. Parity does not show any significant influence on success rate of midurethral sling.",11,"['described by the pgi', 'reflected by the results of king´s health questionnaire']",2,2,0.18181818181818182,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201167,"Influence of age, BMI and parity on the success rate of midurethral slings for stress urinary incontinence"

Aims
Pattern-related visual stress (PRVS) refers to the perceptual difficulties experienced by some individuals when exposed to high contrast striped patterns. People with PRVS were reported to have reduced sensitivity to global motion at baseline testing and the difference disappears at a second estimate. The present study was to investigate the effect of practice on global motion threshold in adults with and without PRVS.



Methods
A total of 101 subjects were recruited and the Wilkins & Evans Pattern Glare Test was used to determine if a subject had PRVS. The threshold to detect global motion was measured with a random dot kinematogram. Each subject was measured 5 times at the first visit and again a month later. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was applied to show the agreement between the two tests.



Results
Twenty-nine subjects were classified as having PRVS and 72 were classified as normal. At baseline, the threshold to detect global motion was significantly higher in subjects with PRVS (0.832 ± 0.098 vs. 0.618 ± 0.228, p < 0.001). After 5 sessions, the difference between the normal and subjects with PRVS increased (0.767 ± 0.170 vs. 0.291 ± 0.149, p < 0.001). In ROC analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) improved from 0.792 at baseline to 0.964 at the fifth session. After a one-month break, the difference between normal and subjects with PRVS was still significant (0.843 ± 0.169 vs. 0.407 ± 0.216, p < 0.001) and the AUC was 0.875.



Conclusion
The ability to detect global motion is impaired in persons with PRVS and the difference increased after additional sessions of practice.",13,"['were reported', 'were recruited', 'was used', 'was measured', 'was measured', 'was applied', 'were classified', 'were classified']",8,6,0.46153846153846156,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193215,Practice makes the deficiency of global motion detection in people with pattern-related visual stress more apparent

Aims
Personality traits are suggested to influence adults’ cognitive performance, but little is known about their association with visuo-spatial competence, in terms of those visuo-spatial abilities and inclinations crucial to remaining autonomous, especially with aging. This study newly investigated whether, and to what extent, major traits and narrower facets of personality influence young and older adults’ performance in the so-called objective visuo-spatial abilities (mental rotation and visuo-spatial working memory [VSWM]), and self-assessed visuo-spatial inclinations (pleasure and anxiety in exploring places).



Method
Seventy young adults (18–35 years old) and 70 older adults (65–75 years old) completed the Big-Five questionnaire, objective rotation and VSWM tasks, and spatial self-assessments on pleasure and anxiety in exploring places.



Results
Hierarchical regression models confirmed that age negatively predicted the variance in objective visuo-spatial tasks, but not in self-assessed visuo-spatial inclinations, while only the latter were slightly influenced by gender (in favor of men). Further, both objective visuo-spatial abilities (albeit modestly) and self-assessed visuo-spatial inclinations were predicted by higher Conscientiousness. The latter were also predicted by higher Emotional Stability. Finally, a better objective visuo-spatial performance was explained (again modestly) by lower Dynamism and Politeness, and higher Emotion Control, while higher Perseverance, Emotion Control and Cooperativeness explained a moderate part of the variance in the positive self-assessed visuo-spatial inclinations.



Conclusions
Our findings indicate that, beyond age and gender, some personality traits and facets predict self-assessed visuo-spatial inclinations to a larger extent than objective visuo-spatial performance. These results are discussed within the spatial cognition and aging framework.",9,"['are suggested', 'is known', 'influenced by gender (in favor of men', 'were predicted', 'were also predicted', 'was explained', 'are discussed']",7,6,0.6666666666666666,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0220525,The influence of personality traits and facets on visuo-spatial task performance and self-assessed visuo-spatial inclinations in young and older adults

Aims
Prevalence of malnutrition is a common and serious issue responsible for the morbidity and mortality rate among hospitalized patients. We aimed to provide an actual and comprehensive situation of the nutritional characteristics, nutritional support and the risk factors for malnutrition among hospitalized patients in China.



Methods
We analyzed the data from nutritionDay audit 2016 in China. The international daylong cross-sectional survey was performed on November 10th, 2016 via filling out several questionnaires regarding information on patients’ illness, food intake history, weight change and nutritional care. Re-assessment of patients’ outcome questionnaire was performed 30 days later.



Results
Total of 781 patients from 9 hospitals and 8 kinds of departments were enrolled in this report. Of these, malnutrition rate was 29.6%. Parenteral nutrition (251/344, 73.0%) was the primary nutrition support form in Chinese hospitals. However, 41.8% (136/325) of patients at nutritional risk or already diagnosed with malnutrition did not received any form of nutritional support, whereas 34.0% (155/456) well-nourished patients did. Patients with malnutrition had extended length of hospital stay and poor 30-day outcomes compared to well-nourished patients. Nutritional support could benefit nutritional risk or malnutrition patients, rather than well-nourished patients. Moreover, major lesion types, self-related health, food intake last week were independent risk factors of malnutrition (all p<0.05).



Conclusions
Chinese hospital staff is generally lack of knowledge and awareness of malnutrition. Self-related health, major lesion types and food intake are associated with malnutrition.",13,"['was performed', 'was performed', 'were enrolled']",3,3,0.23076923076923078,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194312,A comprehensive nutritional survey of hospitalized patients: Results from nutritionDay 2016 in China

Aims
Previous studies and community information about everyday difficulties in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have focussed on domains such as reading and driving. Here, we provide the first in-depth examination of how impaired face perception impacts social interactions and quality of life in AMD. We also develop a Faces and Social Life in AMD brochure and information sheet, plus accompanying conversation starter, aimed at AMD patients and those who interact with them (family, friends, nursing home staff).



Method
Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 21 AMD patients covering the full range from mild vision loss to legally blind. Thematic analysis was used to explore the range of patient experiences.



Results
Patients reported faces appeared blurred and/or distorted. They described recurrent failures to recognise others' identity, facial expressions and emotional states, plus failures of alternative non-face strategies (e.g., hairstyle, voice). They reported failures to follow social nuances (e.g., to pick up that someone was joking), and feelings of missing out ('I can't join in'). Concern about offending others (e.g., by unintentionally ignoring them) was common, as were concerns of appearing fraudulent ('Other people don't understand'). Many reported social disengagement. Many reported specifically face-perception-related reductions in social life, confidence, and quality of life. All effects were observed even with only mild vision loss. Patients endorsed the value of our Faces and Social Life in AMD Information Sheet, developed from the interview results, and supported future technological assistance (digital image enhancement).



Conclusion
Poor face perception in AMD is an important domain contributing to impaired social interactions and quality of life. This domain should be directly assessed in quantitative quality of life measures, and in resources designed to improve community understanding. The identity-related social difficulties mirror those in prosopagnosia, of cortical rather than retinal origin, implying findings may generalise to all low-vision disorders.",16,"['were conducted', 'was used', 'were observed', 'should be directly assessed']",4,4,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0209218,Impacts of impaired face perception on social interactions and quality of life in age-related macular degeneration: A qualitative study and new community resources
"Abstract

Aims
Response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is often assessed six months after implantation. Our objective was to assess the number of patients changing from responder to non-responder between six and 14 months, so-called late non-responders, and compare them to patients who were responder both at six and 14 months, so-called stable responders. Furthermore, we assessed predictive values of six and 14-month response concerning clinical outcome.



Methods
105 patients eligible for CRT were enrolled. Clinical, laboratory, ECG, and echocardiographic parameters and patient-reported health status (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ]) were assessed before, and six and 14 months after implantation. Response was defined as ≥15% LVESV decrease as compared to baseline. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were registered until 24 months after implantation. Predictive values of six and 14-month response for MACE were examined.



Results
In total, 75 (71%) patients were six-month responders of which 12 (16%) patients became late non-responder. At baseline, late non-responders more often had ischemic cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation, higher BNP and less dyssynchrony compared to stable responders. At six months, late non-responders showed significantly less LVESV decrease, and higher creatinine levels. Mean KCCQ scores of late non-responders were lower than those of stable responders at every time point, with the difference being significant at 14 months. The 14 months response was a better predictor of MACE than six months response.



Conclusions
The assessment of treatment outcomes after six months of CRT could be premature and response rates beyond might better correlate to long-term clinical outcome.",15,"['is often assessed', 'were enrolled', 'were assessed', 'was defined', 'were registered', 'were examined']",6,6,0.4,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124323,Volumetric Response beyond Six Months of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy and Clinical Outcome

Aims
Sickness absence is a socioeconomic global burden. In Brazil, mental disorders are the third leading cause of social security benefits payments. The aim of the present study was to compare factors associated with long-term sickness absence between workers who claimed social benefits due to mental disorders or by other causes. We investigated individual features and occupational characteristics. In addition, we evaluated psychosocial factors at work assessed by the Demand-Control-Support (DCS) and Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) models, and whether they were associated with long-term sickness absence due to mental disorders (LTSA-MD).



Methods
The present case-control study was conducted in São Paulo, Brazil. The sample (n = 385) included workers on sick leave for more than 15 days. Cases were the participants with disabling psychiatric illnesses, and controls were the ones with other disabling diseases. Interviews were conducted to assess individual features (sociodemographic data, health habits/lifestyle, health conditions) and occupational characteristics. The participants' perception of exposure to dimensions of the DCS and ERI models was also recorded. Multiple logistic regressions were performed to evaluate the association between independent variables and LTSA-MD.



Results
All the regression analyses showed that LTSA-MD was associated with female sex, self-reported white skin color, higher education level, high tobacco consumption, high alcohol intake, two or more comorbidities, exposure to violence at work, high job strain and low social support at work, effort-reward imbalance and high overcommitment to work. LTSA-MD was associated with separate and combined DCS and ERI stress models.



Conclusions
Individual features and work conditions were associated with LTSA-MD. Combined analysis of stress models showed that psychosocial factors at work were significantly associated with LTSA-MD. Resourceful use of this information may contribute to the implementation of preventive actions and strategies to facilitate return to work targeting the populations most susceptible to mental disorders.",15,"['was conducted', 'were conducted', 'was also recorded', 'were performed']",4,4,0.26666666666666666,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115885,Long-Term Sickness Absence Due to Mental Disorders Is Associated with Individual Features and Psychosocial Work Conditions
"Abstract

Aims
Since the early 1980s, the one-child policy has been implemented nationwide in China. A special group called the “only-child-lost family” (OCL family) has emerged and has become a social phenomenon that cannot be ignored. We report latent profiles of posttraumatic growth and their relation to differences in resilience among OCL people in China.



Methods
A total of 222 OCL people were investigated using the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Latent profile analysis was applied to explore PTG latent profiles. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze the socio-demographic variables in each latent profile and the association between profile membership and resilience.



Results
Three latent profiles were identified and labeled the “high appreciation-power group” (30.6%), the “general moderate growth group” (47.7%) and the “low growth and extreme possibility group” (21.7%). Compared to those in the high appreciation-power group, individuals with monthly income >2000 ($312) were less likely to be in the general moderate growth group (OR = 0.13, P<0.01), whereas individuals with a spouse were less likely to be in the low growth and extreme possibility group (OR = 0.43, P<0.01). Individuals in the “general moderate growth group”(OR = 0.92, P<0.01, 95%CI:0.89–0.94) and the “low growth and extreme possibility” groups (OR = 0.83, P<0.01, 95%CI:0.79–0.87) demonstrated significantly lower levels of resilience compared to the high appreciation-power group.



Conclusion
The PTG patterns in only-child-lost parents were varied. Promoting resilience may be a way to foster these parents’ PTG. Targeted intervention should be developed based on the characteristics of each latent class, and timely attention must be paid to the mental health of OCL parents who are without a spouse and have low income.",12,"['has been implemented', 'be ignored', 'were investigated', 'was applied', 'was used', 'were identified', 'should be developed', 'must be paid']",8,7,0.5833333333333334,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167398,Latent Profiles of Posttraumatic Growth and Their Relation to Differences in Resilience among Only-Child-Lost People in China
"Abstract

Aims
Smaller hippocampal volumes are among the most consistently reported neuroimaging findings in schizophrenia. However, little is known about hippocampal volumes in people who report psychotic experiences. This study investigated differences in hippocampal volume between young people without formal diagnoses who report psychotic experiences (PEs) and those who do not report such experiences. This study also investigated if any differences persisted over two years.



Methods
A nested case-control study of 25 adolescents (mean age 13.5 years) with reported PEs and 25 matched controls (mean age 13.36 years) without PEs were drawn from a sample of 100 local schoolchildren. High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical imaging and subsequent automated cortical segmentation (Freesurfer 6.0) was undertaken to determine total hippocampal volumes. Comprehensive semi-structured clinical interviews were also performed including information on PEs, mental diagnoses and early life stress (bullying). Participants were invited for a second scan at two years.



Results
19 adolescents with PEs and 19 controls completed both scans. Hippocampal volumes were bilaterally lower in the PE group compared to the controls with moderate effects sizes both at baseline [left hippocampus p = 0.024 d = 0.736, right hippocampus p = 0.018, d = 0.738] and at 2 year follow up [left hippocampus p = 0.027 d = 0.702, right = 0.048 d = 0.659] throughout. These differences survived adjustment for co-morbid mental disorders and early life stress.



Conclusions
Psychotic experiences are associated with total hippocampal volume loss in young people and this volume loss appears to be independent of possible confounders such as co-morbid disorders and early life stress.",14,"['is known', 'were drawn', 'was undertaken', 'were also performed', 'were invited']",5,5,0.35714285714285715,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233670,Reduced hippocampal volume in adolescents with psychotic experiences: A longitudinal population-based study
"Abstract

Aims
Social scientists have postulated that the discrepancy between achievements and expectations affects individuals' subjective well-being. Still, little has been done to qualify and quantify such a psychological effect. Our empirical analysis assesses the consequences of positive and negative affective forecasting errors—the difference between realized and expected subjective well-being—on the subsequent level of subjective well-being.



Data
We use longitudinal data on a representative sample of 13,431 individuals from the German Socio-Economic Panel. In our sample, 52% of individuals are females, average age is 43 years, average years of education is 11.4 and 27% of our sample lives in East Germany. Subjective well-being (measured by self-reported life satisfaction) is assessed on a 0–10 discrete scale and its sample average is equal to 6.75 points.



Methods
We develop a simple theoretical framework to assess the consequences of positive and negative affective forecasting errors—the difference between realized and expected subjective well-being—on the subsequent level of subjective well-being, properly accounting for the endogenous adjustment of expectations to positive and negative affective forecasting errors, and use it to derive testable predictions. Given the theoretical framework, we estimate two panel-data equations, the first depicting the association between positive and negative affective forecasting errors and the successive level of subjective well-being and the second describing the correlation between subjective well-being expectations for the future and hedonic failures and successes. Our models control for individual fixed effects and a large battery of time-varying demographic characteristics, health and socio-economic status.



Results and conclusions
While surpassing expectations is uncorrelated with subjective well-being, failing to match expectations is negatively associated with subsequent realizations of subjective well-being. Expectations are positively (negatively) correlated to positive (negative) forecasting errors. We speculate that in the first case the positive adjustment in expectations is strong enough to cancel out the potential positive effects on subjective well-being of beaten expectations, while in the second case it is not, and individuals persistently bear the negative emotional consequences of not achieving expectations.",12,"['has been done', 'is assessed', 'is uncorrelated']",3,3,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192941,Asymmetric affective forecasting errors and their correlation with subjective well-being

Aims
Temperament and impulsivity are powerful predictors of addiction treatment outcomes. However, a comprehensive assessment of these features has not been examined in relation to smoking cessation outcomes.



Methods
Naturalistic prospective study. Treatment-seeking smokers (n = 140) were recruited as they engaged in an occupational health clinic providing smoking cessation treatment between 2009 and 2013. Participants were assessed at baseline with measures of temperament (Temperament and Character Inventory), trait impulsivity (Barratt Impulsivity Scale), and cognitive impulsivity (Go/No Go, Delay Discounting and Iowa Gambling Task). The outcome measure was treatment status, coded as “dropout” versus “relapse” versus “abstinence” at 3, 6, and 12 months endpoints. Participants were telephonically contacted and reminded of follow-up face to face assessments at each endpoint. The participants that failed to answer the phone calls or self-reported discontinuation of treatment and failed to attend the upcoming follow-up session were coded as dropouts. The participants that self-reported continuing treatment, and successfully attended the upcoming follow-up session were coded as either “relapse” or “abstinence”, based on the results of smoking behavior self-reports cross-validated with co-oximetry hemoglobin levels. Multinomial regression models were conducted to test whether temperament and impulsivity measures predicted dropout and relapse relative to abstinence outcomes.



Results
Higher scores on temperament dimensions of novelty seeking and reward dependence predicted poorer retention across endpoints, whereas only higher scores on persistence predicted greater relapse. Higher scores on the trait dimension of non-planning impulsivity but not performance on cognitive impulsivity predicted poorer retention. Higher non-planning impulsivity and poorer performance in the Iowa Gambling Task predicted greater relapse at 3 and 6 months and 6 months respectively.



Conclusion
Temperament measures, and specifically novelty seeking and reward dependence, predict smoking cessation treatment retention, whereas persistence, non-planning impulsivity and poor decision-making predict smoking relapse.",13,"['been examined', 'were recruited', 'were assessed', 'were telephonically contacted and reminded of', 'were coded', 'were coded', 'were conducted']",7,7,0.5384615384615384,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0112440,Temperament and Impulsivity Predictors of Smoking Cessation Outcomes

Aims
The aim of the study was to assess the concordance of care for age related macular degeneration with the evidence-based framework for care for chronic medical conditions known as the chronic care model. Furthermore we aimed to identify factors associated with the concordance of care with the chronic care model.



Methods
Multi-centered cross-sectional study. 169 patients beginning medical treatment for age related macular degeneration were recruited and analyzed. Patients completed the Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC) questionnaire, reflecting accordance to the chronic care model from a patient’s perspective, the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Visual acuity and chronic medical conditions were assessed. Nonparametric tests and correlation analyses were performed, also multivariable regression analysis.



Results
The median PACIC summary score was 2.4 (interquartile range 1.75 to 3.25), the lowest PACIC subscale score was “follow-up/coordination” with a median of 1.8 (interquartile range 1.00 to 2.60). In multivariable regression analysis the presence of diabetes type 2 was strongly associated with low PACIC scores (coefficient = −0.85, p = 0.007).



Conclusion
Generally, care for patients with age related macular degeneration by ophthalmologists is in moderate concordance with the chronic care model. Concerning follow-up and coordination of health service, large improvements are possible. Future research should answer the question how healthcare delivery can be improved effecting relevant benefits to patients with AMD.",13,"['were recruited and analyzed.', 'were assessed', 'were performed', 'can be improved']",4,4,0.3076923076923077,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0108536,The Concordance of Care for Age Related Macular Degeneration with the Chronic Care Model: A Multi-Centered Cross-Sectional Study

Aims
The aim of this study was to establish ‘Timed up and Go’ test (TUG) normative data among community dwelling older adults stratified based on cognitive status, gender and age groups.



Methods
A total of 2084 community dwelling older adults from wave I and II were recruited through a multistage random sampling method. TUG was performed using the standard protocol and scores were then stratified based on with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI), gender and in a 5-year age groups ranging from ages of 60’s to 80’s.



Results
529(16%) participants were identified to have MCI. Past history of falls and medical history of hypertension, heart disease, joint pain, hearing and vision problem, and urinary incontinence were found to have influenced TUG performance. Cognitive status as a mediator, predicted TUG performance even when both gender and age were controlled for (B 0.24, 95% CI (0.02–0.47), β 0.03, t 2.10, p = 0.36). Further descriptive analysis showed, participants with MCI, women and older in age took a longer time to complete TUG, as compared to men with MCI across all age groups with exceptions for some age groups.



Conclusion
These results suggested that MCI needs to be taken into consideration when testing older adults using TUG, besides age and gender factors. Data using fast speed TUG may be required among older adults with and without MCI for further understanding.",8,"['were recruited', 'was performed', 'were then stratified', 'were identified', 'were found', 'were controlled', 'be taken', 'may be required']",8,5,0.625,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185641,"‘Timed Up and Go’ test: Age, gender and cognitive impairment stratified normative values of older adults"

Aims
The aim of this study was to examine whether non-verbal therapies are effective in treating depressive symptoms in psychotic disorders.



Material and Methods
A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Psychinfo, Picarta, Embase and ISI Web of Science, up to January 2015. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a non-verbal intervention to a control condition in patients with psychotic disorders, whilst measuring depressive symptoms as a primary or secondary outcome, were included. The quality of studies was assessed using the ‘Clinical Trials Assessment Measure for psychological treatments’ (CTAM) scale. Cohen’s d was calculated as a measure of effect size. Using a Network Meta-analysis, both direct and indirect evidence was investigated.



Results
10 RCTs were included, of which three were of high quality according to the CTAM. The direct evidence demonstrated a significant effect on the reduction in depressive symptoms relative to treatment as usual (TAU), in favor of overall non-verbal therapy (ES: -0.66, 95% C.I. = -0.88, -0.44) and music therapy (ES: -0.59, 95% C.I. = -0.85, -0.33). Combining both direct and indirect evidence, yoga therapy (ES: -0.79, 95% C.I. = -1.24, -0.35) had a significant effect on depressive symptoms, and occupational therapy (ES: 1.81, 95% C.I. = 0.81, 2.81) was less effective, relative to TAU. Exercise therapy did not show a significant effect on depressive symptoms in comparison to TAU (ES: -0.02 95% C.I. = -0.67, 0.62). Due to inconsistency of study evidence, the indirect effects should be interpreted cautiously.



Conclusions
Non-verbal therapies appear to be effective in reducing depressive symptomatology in psychotic disorders, in particular music therapy and yoga therapy.",18,"['was performed', 'were included', 'was assessed', 'was calculated', 'was investigated', 'were included', 'should be interpreted']",7,6,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140637,Treating Depressive Symptoms in Psychosis: A Network Meta-Analysis on the Effects of Non-Verbal Therapies

Aims
The aim of this study was to investigate whether the relation between responsibility for domestic work and psychological distress was influenced by perception of gender inequality in the couple relationship and relative socioeconomic position.



Methods
In the Northern Swedish Cohort, all pupils who studied in the last year of compulsory school in a northern Swedish town in 1981 have been followed regularly until 2007. In this study, participants living with children were selected (n = 371 women, 352 men). The importance of relative socioeconomic position and perception of gender inequality in the couple relationship in combination with domestic work for psychological distress was examined through logistic regression analysis.



Results
Two combinations of variables including socioeconomic position (‘having less than half of the responsibility for domestic work and partner higher socioeconomic position’ and ‘having more than half the responsibility for domestic work and equal socioeconomic position’) were related to psychological distress. There were also higher ORs for psychological distress for the combinations of having ‘less than half of the responsibility for domestic work and gender-unequal couple relationship’ and ‘more than half the responsibility for domestic work and gender-unequal couple relationship’. Having a lower socioeconomic position than the partner was associated with higher ORs for psychological distress among men.



Conclusions
This study showed that domestic work is a highly gendered activity as women tend to have a greater and men a smaller responsibility. Both these directions of inequality in domestic work, in combination with experiencing the couple relationship as gender-unequal, were associated with psychological distress There is a need for more research with a relational approach on inequalities in health in order to capture the power relations within couples in various settings.",10,"['was influenced', 'have been followed', 'were selected', 'was examined', 'were related']",5,5,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0038484,Domestic Work and Psychological Distress−What Is the Importance of Relative Socioeconomic Position and Gender Inequality in the Couple Relationship?

Aims
The cognitive profile of Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1) has been described in recent decades. Moreover, DM1 patients show lowered social engagement and difficulties in social-cognitive functions. The aim of the present study is to explore whether social cognition impairment is present in DM1 taking into account the overall cognitive condition.



Method
38 patients and a control group paired in age and gender participated in the study. All the participants had an IQ within the normal range. Subjects were administered an abbreviated neuropsychological battery which comprised a facial emotion recognition test (POFA) and Faux Pas Test, as well as a self-report questionnaire on cognitive and affective empathy (TECA).



Results
Statistically significant differences were found only for facial emotion recognition (U = 464.0, p = .006) with a moderate effect size (.31), with the controls obtaining a higher score than the patients. Analyzing each emotion separately, DM1 patients scored significantly lower than controls on the recognition of anger and disgust items. Emotion recognition did not correlate with genetic load, but did correlate negatively with age. No differences were found between patients and controls in any of the other variables related to Theory of Mind (ToM) and empathy.



Conclusion
DM1 does not manifest specific impairments in ToM since difficulties in this area predominantly rely on the cognitive demand of the tasks employed. However, a more basic process such as emotion recognition appears as a core deficit. The role of this deficit as a marker of aging related decline is discussed.",13,"['has been described', 'were administered', 'were found', 'were found', 'is discussed']",5,5,0.38461538461538464,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204227,Social cognition in myotonic dystrophy type 1: Specific or secondary impairment?

Aims
The main aim of the present review was to update the available evidence on the value interest of post-competition recovery strategies in male professional or semi-professional soccer players to determine its effect on post-game performance outcomes, physiological markers, and wellness indicators.



Methods
A structured search was carried out following the PRISMA guidelines using six online databases: Pubmed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The risk of bias was completed following the Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials were conducted to determine the between and within-group effects of different recovery strategies on performance, physiological markers and wellness data. Final meta-analyses were performed using the random-effects model and pooled standardized mean differences (SMD).



Results
Five randomized controlled trials that used Compression Garments (n = 3), Cold Water Immersion (n = 1), and acute Sleep Hygiene Strategy (n = 1) were included. Greater CMJ values at 48h for the intervention group (SMD = 0.70; 95% CI 0.14 to 1.25; p = 0.001; I2 = 10.4%) were found. For the 20-m sprint and MVC, the results showed no difference either at 24h or 48h. For physiological markers (CK and CRP) and wellness data (DOMS), small to large SMD were present in favor of the intervention group both at 24h (-0.12 to -1.86) and 48h (-0.21 to -0.85). No heterogeneity was present, except for MVC at 24h (I2 = 90.4%; p = 0.0012) and CALF DOMS at 48h (I2 = 93.7%; p = 0.013).



Conclusion
The use of recovery strategies offers significant positive effects only in jumping performance (CMJ), with no effects on the 20-m sprint or MVC. Also, the use of recovery strategies offers greater positive effects on muscle damage (physiological markers and wellness data), highlighting the importance of post-match recovery strategies in soccer.",12,"['was carried', 'was completed', 'were conducted', 'were performed', 'were included', 'were found']",6,6,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240135,Post-competition recovery strategies in elite male soccer players.

Aims
The main focus of this study is to illustrate the importance of the statistical analysis in the evaluation of the accuracy of malaria diagnostic tests, without admitting a reference test, exploring a dataset (3317) collected in São Tomé and Príncipe.



Methods
Bayesian Latent Class Models (without and with constraints) are used to estimate the malaria infection prevalence, together with sensitivities, specificities, and predictive values of three diagnostic tests (RDT, Microscopy and PCR), in four subpopulations simultaneously based on a stratified analysis by age groups (,  5 years old) and fever status (febrile, afebrile).



Results
In the afebrile individuals with at least five years old, the posterior mean of the malaria infection prevalence is 3.2% with a highest posterior density interval of [2.3–4.1]. The other three subpopulations (febrile  5 years, afebrile or febrile children less than 5 years) present a higher prevalence around 10.3% [8.8–11.7]. In afebrile children under-five years old, the sensitivity of microscopy is 50.5% [37.7–63.2]. In children under-five, the estimated sensitivities/specificities of RDT are 95.4% [90.3–99.5]/93.8% [91.6–96.0] – afebrile – and 94.1% [87.5–99.4]/97.5% [95.5–99.3] – febrile. In individuals with at least five years old are 96.0% [91.5–99.7]/98.7% [98.1–99.2] – afebrile – and 97.9% [95.3–99.8]/97.7% [96.6–98.6] – febrile. The PCR yields the most reliable results in four subpopulations.



Conclusions
The utility of this RDT in the field seems to be relevant. However, in all subpopulations, data provide enough evidence to suggest caution with the positive predictive values of the RDT. Microscopy has poor sensitivity compared to the other tests, particularly, in the afebrile children less than 5 years. This type of findings reveals the danger of statistical analysis based on microscopy as a reference test. Bayesian Latent Class Models provide a powerful tool to evaluate malaria diagnostic tests, taking into account different groups of interest.",13,['are used'],1,1,0.07692307692307693,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0040633,Bayesian Latent Class Models in Malaria Diagnosis

The main objective of the study was to find out prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms in the population of patients with AMI with ST-segment elevation (STEMI), treated with primary PCI (pPCI). Secondary target indicators included the incidence of sleep disorders and loss of interest in sex.



Methods and results
The project enrolled 79 consecutive patients with the first AMI, aged <80 years (median 61 years, 21.5% of women) with a follow-up period of 12 months. Symptoms of depression or anxiety were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory II tests (BDI-II, cut-off value ≥14) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS, cut-off ≥ 45) within 24 hours of pPCI, before the discharge, and in 3, 6 and 12 months). Results with the value p<0.05 were considered as statistically significant. The BDI-II positivity was highest within 24 hours after pPCI (21.5%) with a significant decline prior to the discharge (9.2%), but with a gradual increase in 3, 6 and 12 months (10.4%; 15.4%; 13.8% respectively). The incidence of anxiety showed a relatively similar trend: 8.9% after pPCI, and 4.5%, 10.8% and 6.2% in further follow-up.



Conclusions
Patients with STEMI treated by primary PCI have relatively low overall prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety. A significant decrease in mental stress was observed before discharge from the hospital, but in a period of one year after pPCI, prevalence of both symptoms was gradually increasing, which should be given medical attention.",9,"['were measured', 'were considered', 'was observed', 'should be given']",4,3,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152367,Depression and Anxiety after Acute Myocardial Infarction Treated by Primary PCI
"Abstract

Aims
The objective of this study is to investigate whether type of depressive symptoms (i.e. cognitive-affective or somatic) is related to a patient-perceived need for professional psychological care in individuals with diabetes.



Methods
In total 2266 participants were recruited as part of the screening procedure for a multi-center randomized controlled trial on the treatment of depressive symptoms among individuals with diabetes. Individuals were invited to complete Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Patients with elevated depressive symptoms (BDI-II ≥14) were interviewed about their psychological care need. Based on their care needs patients were categorized into: unmet need, no need, met need and unclear need. These groups were compared on type of depressive symptoms, as categorized into cognitive-affective symptoms and somatic symptoms.



Results
568 eligible individuals had elevated depressive symptoms, of whom 519 were reached. Among these depressed individuals, 19.7% (102 of 519) had an unmet need for psychological care. Participants with an unmet need were younger (p<0.001) and had higher total depression scores compared to the group with no need (p<0.001). They also scored higher on cognitive-affective symptoms (p<0.001), whereas somatic symptoms did not significantly differ (p = 0.232). Logistic regression revealed that cognitive-affective symptoms predicted an unmet need (p = 0.001). However, overall predictive capacity of type of depressive symptoms on care needs was weak.



Conclusions
Cognitive-affective symptoms of depression—but not somatic symptoms—were associated with an unmet need for psychological care among depressed individuals with diabetes. Future research is needed to reveal better predictors explaining the discrepancy between distress and low care needs in order to optimize screening procedures.",16,"['is related', 'were recruited', 'were invited', 'were interviewed', 'were categorized', 'were compared', 'were reached', 'is needed']",8,8,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0212304,Is type of depressive symptoms associated with patient-perceived need for professional psychological care in depressed individuals with diabetes?
"Abstract

Aims
The objective of this study was therefore to analyze the effect of exceptionally stressful situations, such as the current health risk, on the cognitive and emotive state of the individual, that is, perceived threat and emotional state on affect and mood.



Method
This was a cross-sectional study with snowball sampling. The sample came to 1014 Spanish adults (67.2% women and 32.8% men). The Perception of Threat from COVID-19 questionnaire, the Affective Balance Scale and the Mood Evaluation Scale were used.



Results
The results showed that the perception of threat from COVID-19 was related positively to negative affect and emotional signs, that is, sadness-depression, anxiety and anger-hostility. There was a direct positive effect of perceived threat from COVID-19 on sadness-depression, anxiety and anger-hostility moods, while anxiety and anger-hostility had a direct positive effect on perception of threat from the virus. Thus, there was a circular relationship, in which perceived threat influenced the presence of negative mood, and negative mood, in turn, linked to emotions of irritation and agitation from a present situation, promoted the feeling of threat.



Conclusions
A negative affective balance increases both one’s perception of threat from COVID-19 and negative mood. Thus, knowing the emotional and cognitive effects on the population would enable measures to be put into service to facilitate their effective coping.",10,"['were used', 'was related', 'be put']",3,3,0.3,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0235305,Threat of COVID-19 and emotional state during quarantine: Positive and negative affect as mediators in a cross-sectional study of the Spanish population
"Abstract

Aims
The objective of this study was to investigate the longitudinal trajectory of BMI in the Chinese population, and to assess whether the gender or other personal characteristics were related to BMI, and whether there was a change in trajectory over time.



Methods
Data were obtained from 3,574 Chinese (5 to 89 years of age) who participated in the 2000–2011 of the China Health and Nutrition Survey. Latent growth curve models were used to investigate the longitudinal trajectory of BMI, and to examine the effect of some personal characteristics on BMI trajectory.



Results
The linear model resulted in a mean initial BMI value of 22.90 and a significant mean slope (Ms = 0.19, t = 10.73, p<0.001), suggesting a steady increase in BMI over time for the whole sample. For covariates, the educational level, alcohol and physical activity had differences on initial scores for BMI (β = 0.05, p<0.001; β = -0.12, p<0.05; β = -0.08, p<0.05; respectively.), and the age had differences on both the initial scores and slope for BMI (β = 0.01, p = <0.05; β = -0.03, p<0.01; respectively.). Baseline measures revealed gender-associated differences on initial scores for BMI, and the slope for male was significantly steeper than that for female (β = -0.11, p<0.05). The initial BMI status of Chinese living in the rural areas was significantly higher than that of Chinese living in the urban areas, and the slope for rural status was significantly steeper than that for urban status (β = 0.21, p<0.001).



Conclusions
Results indicated a linear trajectory of BMI in the Chinese population over a 12-year period. The longitudinal trajectories differed by age, gender and urban-rural status, suggesting different interventions should be adopted for different groups.",10,"['were related', 'were obtained', 'were used', 'should be adopted']",4,4,0.4,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207845,The longitudinal trajectory of body mass index in the Chinese population: A latent growth curve analysis
"Abstract

Aims
The study aims to describe the construct of cognitive distortions based on the narratives of older adult gamblers (aged 60 years and above) in Singapore.



Methods
Singapore residents (citizens or permanent residents) aged 60 years and above, who were current or past regular gamblers were included in the study. Participants were recruited using a combination of venue based approach, referrals from service providers as well as by snowball sampling. In all, 25 in-depth interviews were conducted with older adult gamblers. The six-step thematic network analysis methodology was adopted for data analysis.



Results
The mean age of the participants was 66.2 years. The majority were male (n = 18), of Chinese ethnicity (n = 16), with a mean age of gambling initiation at 24.5 years. Among older adult gamblers, cognitive distortions emerged as a significant global theme comprising three organizing themes–illusion of control, probability control and interpretive control. The organizing themes comprised nine basic themes: perception of gambling as a skill, near miss, concept of luck, superstitious beliefs, entrapment, gambler’s fallacy, chasing wins, chasing losses, and beliefs that wins are more than losses.



Conclusions
Cognitive distortions were endorsed by all gamblers in the current study and were shown to play a role in both maintaining and escalating the gambling behaviour. While the surface characteristics of the distortions had a culture-specific appearance, the deeper characteristics of the distortions may in fact be more universal than previously thought. Future research must include longitudinal studies to understand causal relationships between cognitive distortions and gambling as well as the role of culture-specific distortions both in the maintenance and treatment of the disorder.",13,"['were included', 'were recruited', 'were conducted', 'was adopted', 'were endorsed', 'were shown']",6,5,0.38461538461538464,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0178036,Cognitive distortions among older adult gamblers in an Asian context

Aims
There have been few studies on the disparities within the population with disabilities, especially in China. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in some health conditions among people with different types of disabilities in Shanghai.



Methods
This study was conducted using data from the Shanghai Disabled Persons’ Rehabilitation Comprehensive Information Platform. The records of 31,082 persons with disabilities who had undergone professional health examination were analyzed, and the prevalence and number of five diseases and five risk factors were examined. Logistic regression was used to explore disparities from two perspectives: 1) basic differences, unadjusted for other factors, and 2) differences after adjusting for key demographic covariates. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.



Results
Individuals with visual disability had a high rate of refractive error (60.0%), and averaged 1.75 diseases of interest, which was the highest value among all disability types. The mean number of risk factors we measured was greatest (1.96) in the population with mental disability. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) between the hearing and speech impairment group and the other groups with respect to most health outcomes, except chronic pharyngitis, hepatic cysts, and high blood pressure.



Conclusion
Significant differences of selected health outcomes between groups with different types of disabilities remained after controlling for key demographic indicators. Further research is needed to explore the relationships between health conditions and disability types.",12,"['was conducted', 'were analyzed', 'were examined', 'was used', 'was considered', 'is needed']",6,5,0.4166666666666667,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0155700,"Health Disparities by Type of Disability: Health Examination Results of Adults (18-64 Years) with Disabilities in Shanghai, China"
"Abstract

Aims
There is strong evidence that diets high in salt are bad for health and that salt reduction strategies are cost effective. However, whilst it is clear that most people are eating too much salt, obtaining an accurate assessment of population salt intake is not straightforward, particularly in resource poor settings. The objective of this study is to identify what approaches governments are taking to monitoring salt intake, with the ultimate goal of identifying what actions are needed to address challenges to monitoring salt intake, especially in low and middle-income countries.



Methods and Results
A written survey was issued to governments to establish the details of their monitoring methods. Of the 30 countries that reported conducting formal government salt monitoring activities, 73% were high income countries. Less than half of the 30 countries, used the most accurate assessment of salt through 24 hour urine, and only two of these were developing countries. The remainder mainly relied on estimates through dietary surveys.



Conclusions
The study identified a strong need to establish more practical ways of assessing salt intake as well as technical support and advice to ensure that low and middle income countries can implement salt monitoring activities effectively.",8,"['are cost', 'are needed', 'was issued']",3,3,0.375,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0046727,National Approaches to Monitoring Population Salt Intake: A Trade-Off between Accuracy and Practicality?

Aims
This prospective, repeated measures study utilized a convergent parallel mixed methods approach to assess sleep experiences among individuals who were alcohol-dependent undergoing inpatient detoxification and treatment at a clinical research facility across the transition periods associated with the rehabilitation process: the initial adjustment to becoming an inpatient and the transition from inpatient to outpatient status.



Methods
This study included individual semi-structured interviews and quantitative measures relating to psychological distress, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and sleep-related beliefs and behavior (n = 33; 66.7% male). Interviews were conducted and questionnaires were administered within one week of participants’ scheduled discharge date and again four to six weeks post-discharge when they returned for a follow-up visit (or via phone).



Results
Participants self-reported significant sleep disturbances at both study time points. Of those participants with valid data at both time points (n = 28), there were no significant changes in mean scores from pre- to post-discharge with the exception of self-efficacy for sleep (SE-S) being significantly higher post-discharge. Preliminary qualitative findings suggested differences between those with ongoing sleep disturbances, those whose sleep disturbances had resolved, and those with no sleep disturbances at either time point.



Conclusions
This analysis highlights individual variation in sleep throughout the process of inpatient treatment and transition to outpatient aftercare in individuals with alcohol dependence. Collecting quantitative and qualitative data concurrently and combining emerging themes from qualitative data with quantitative analyses allowed for a more thorough examination of this relatively novel area of research and provided information that can be utilized to inform future behavioral sleep interventions.",8,"['were conducted', 'were administered', 'can be utilized']",3,2,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161725,Critical Transitions: A Mixed Methods Examination of Sleep from Inpatient Alcohol Rehabilitation Treatment to the Community
"Abstract

Aims
This research aimed to assess the application to the gambling industry, of Corporate Political Activity (CPA) analysis previously developed from public health research on tobacco industry interactions with political institutions and previously applied to the alcohol industry, but not the gambling industry.



Background
A growing body of literature has confirmed how public interest outcomes are frequently opposed by vested interests. This research focused on gambling industry submissions to a 2013 Australian Parliamentary inquiry into sports betting advertising. Gambling advertising became highly controversial following deregulation of sports betting advertising in Australia subsequent to the 2008 Australian High Court Betfair challenge. The dramatic increase in gambling advertising during sporting event broadcasts at children’s viewing times and on new interactive technology, sparked public concerns. A series of national regulatory reviews followed and the gambling industry was actively involved in opposing further regulation.



Method
The research used a corporate political activity (CPA) framework of analysis developed by UK tobacco public health researchers, which identified strategies and tactics used internationally by the tobacco industry, to broker pro-tobacco public policy outcomes. Testing the application of this CPA framework to gambling pro-industry strategies/tactics, this research focused on gambling industry submissions to the 2013 Australian Parliamentary Committee Inquiry.



Results
Like the tobacco industry, the research found the gambling industry used identified strategies and tactics, some new tactics and a new strategy of ‘Corporate Social Responsibility’, promoting ‘responsible’ industry practices and pre-emptive establishment of internal ‘responsibility’ units/practices. Despite public concerns regarding sports betting advertising, the gambling industry reinforced individual choice/blame for harms and claimed it acted responsibly. It did this using strategies identified in the tobacco industry CPA framework: information strategy (and shaping the evidence base); financial incentive strategy; constituency building strategy; policy substitution strategy; legal strategy; and constituency fragmentation and destabilization strategy.



Conclusion
Similar to the CPA analysis applied to tobacco and alcohol industries, the research demonstrated the usefulness of the CPA taxonomy for analyzing and documenting pre-emptive industry policy strategies and tactics, exposing gambling industry efforts to maintain industry self-regulation via voluntary codes and avoid more government regulation. Cross-sectoral application of the framework signals great potential for use of CPA by policymakers and public health advocates as a tool in the analysis of corporate industry arguments/discourses.",14,"['analysis previously developed', 'are frequently opposed']",2,2,0.14285714285714285,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0205654,Applying Corporate Political Activity (CPA) analysis to Australian gambling industry submissions against regulation of television sports betting advertising

Aims
This study aimed to systematically review intervention studies on self-management of type 2 diabetes in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to determine the most effective self-management strategies for individuals with type 2 diabetes in this region.



Methods
A search strategy was developed using multiple databases: Medline and Embase (via Ovid), CINAHL (via EBSCO), and PubMed. Study and intervention characteristics, intervention structure, content, cultural adaptation, and outcomes were extracted from the included studies. To be included in the review the studies should have met the following criteria: have examined the effectiveness of at least one intervention involving a type 2 DSME programme, have involved participants over 18 years old diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, have taken place to in a GCC country, have a study design that was observational, quasi-experimental or controlled, have reported at least one individual and have a quantitative outcome. A narrative data synthesis was used to describe the studies and comment on their methodological quality.



Results
Of the 737 retrieved papers, only eight met the inclusion criteria. Only one study was a randomised controlled trial. A statistically significant improvement in HbA1c was reported in five of the eight studies. There was a significant improvement in physical activity levels as reported in four of the eight studies. Only three studies referred to aspects of cultural design or adaptation of the intervention implemented.



Conclusions
Self-management interventions may have a positive impact on HbA1 levels in patients with type 2 diabetes in the GCC area. A greater emphasis placed on culturally appropriate self-management programmes may improve the effectiveness of self-management interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes in the GCC.",13,"['was developed', 'were extracted', 'be included', 'was used', 'was reported']",5,5,0.38461538461538464,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0189160,Self-management of type 2 diabetes in gulf cooperation council countries: A systematic review

Aims
This study documented the treatment cascade for engagement in care and abstinence at treatment exit as well as examined correlates of these outcomes for the first certified Matrix Model® substance abuse treatment site in Sub-Saharan Africa.



Design
This retrospective chart review conducted at a resource-limited community clinic in Cape Town, South Africa, assessed treatment readiness and substance use severity at treatment entry as correlates of the number of sessions attended and biologically confirmed abstinence at treatment exit among 986 clients who initiated treatment from 2009–2014. Sociodemographic and clinical correlates of treatment outcomes were examined using logistic regression, modeling treatment completion and abstinence at treatment exit separately.



Results
Of the 2,233 clients who completed screening, approximately 44% (n = 986) initiated treatment. Among those who initiated treatment, 45% completed at least four group sessions, 30% completed early recovery skills training (i.e., at least eight group sessions), and 13% completed the full 16-week program. Approximately half (54%) of clients who provided a urine sample had negative urine toxicology results for any substance at treatment exit. Higher motivation at treatment entry was independently associated with greater odds of treatment completion and negative urine toxicology results at treatment exit.



Conclusions
Findings provide initial support for the successful implementation the Matrix Model in a resource-limited setting. Motivational enhancement interventions could support treatment initiation, promote sustained engagement in treatment, and achieve better treatment outcomes.",9,['were examined'],1,1,0.1111111111111111,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147900,Implementation of Cognitive-Behavioral Substance Abuse Treatment in Sub-Saharan Africa: Treatment Engagement and Abstinence at Treatment Exit

Aims
This study evaluated the psychometric characteristics of the Polish version of the PHQ-9 in detecting major depression (MDD) and ‘MDD and/or dysthymia’ in people with and without type 2 diabetes.



Methods
Participants were randomly selected from a diabetes outpatient facility (N = 216) and from among patients admitted to a medical center and psychiatric hospital (N = 99). The participants completed the PHQ-9. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview were used to identify the presence of psychiatric symptoms. The optimal cut-offs for PHQ-9 in people with and without type 2 diabetes were investigated based on two methods: 1) Youden’s index which identifies cut-off points useful in scientific research; 2) a second method of two-stage screening for depressive disorders to provide guidance for clinical practice.



Results
The Polish version of the PHQ-9 is a reliable and valid screening tool for depression in people with and without type 2 diabetes. An optimal cut-off of ≥ 7 was indicated by Youden’s index and ≥ 5 by the two-stage method for screening for MDD and ‘MDD and/or dysthymia’ in the group with type 2 diabetes. A cut-off of ≥ 11 was optimal for screening for both MDD and ‘MDD and/or dysthymia’ among people without diabetes (Youden’s index). The two-stage approach suggested a ≥ 10 score for screening for MDD and ≥ 9 for screening for ‘MDD and/or dysthymia’ in people without diabetes.



Conclusions
A lower cut-off score of the PHQ-9 is recommended for people with type 2 diabetes as compared to the general population.",11,"['were randomly selected', 'were used', 'were investigated', 'was indicated', 'is recommended']",5,5,0.45454545454545453,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240209,People with diabetes need a lower cut-off than others for depression screening with PHQ-9

Aims
This study explores the differences in sickness absence trends in women according to reproductive age group and medical diagnoses.



Methods
Data were obtained from two administrative registries: the Continuous Working Life Sample and the Catalonian Institute of Medical Evaluations from 2012 to 2014, containing 47,879 female employees. Incidence rates and incidence risk ratios derived from Poisson and negative binomial models were calculated to compare sickness absence trends among reproductive age groups based on Catalonian birthrates: early-reproductive (25–34 years old), middle-reproductive (35–44) and late-reproductive (45–54), according to diagnostic groups, selected diseases, type of contract, occupational category, and country of origin.



Results
Younger women show a higher incidence of overall sickness absence compared to late-reproductive-aged women. Incidence risk ratios of sickness absence decreased significantly from early-reproductive to late-reproductive age for low back pain, hemorrhage in early pregnancy, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal and pelvic pain.



Discussion
The higher incidence of sickness absence due to pregnancy-related health conditions in early-reproductive women compared to other reproductive age groups, may explain the sickness absence differences by age in women. Proper management of sickness absence related to pregnancy should be a goal to reduce the sickness absence gap between younger and older women.",8,"['were obtained', 'were calculated']",2,2,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237794,"Do birthrates contribute to sickness absence differences in women?

Aims
This study is based on two experiments, the first, with an exploratory character. The aim of which is to assess the capacity of native vs international pop songs (NAT vs INT) from two consecutive life stages, Reminiscence bump (RB) and the immediately subsequent period (No reminiscence bump, NORB) to elicit positive emotions and autobiographical memories.



Method
A total of 15 middle-aged adults and 15 older adults participated in Experiment 1 (E1). Emotionality, song familiarity and associated autobiographical memories were assessed. Each participant was exposed to 20 randomly selected age-specific songs. Pre-and post-test measures of mood state were also included. Experiment 2 (E2) focused on late adulthood, using a sample of 35 persons. The experimental design was similar to that used in E1. However, this second experiment also included an analysis of the types of autobiographical memories generated by the experimental task and a study of their relationship with the characteristics of the songs, their familiarity and the emotions they produced, and the number of trials. The aim was to delve into the effects that influence the effectiveness of the induction procedure, particularly as regards emotional positivity and memory specificity.



Results
Regarding age effect, E1 results varied: under some conditions, emotionality showed no difference between groups, others showed positive older adult bias. In E2, the analysis of the relationships between memory types and the selected variables suggests the latter are not useful predictors of differences between memory types. The study design yielded a relatively high level of memory specificity and emotional positivity.



Conclusion
The findings question positivity bias in the elderly. RB music produces different effects depending on age. Enculturation can be an important mediating factor in emotionality and memory. Finally, experimental design improves specific memory and positivity.",18,"['were assessed', 'was exposed', 'were also included']",3,3,0.16666666666666666,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0238434,Autobiographical emotional induction in older people through popular songs: Effect of reminiscence bump and enculturation

Aims
This survey aims to describe the perception of barriers to and facilitators of research utilization by registered nurses in Sichuan province, China, and to explore the factors influencing the perceptions of the barriers to and facilitators of research utilization.



Methods
A cross sectional survey design and a double cluster sampling method were adopted. A total of 590 registered nurses from 3 tertiary level hospitals in Sichuan province, China, were recruited in a period from September 2006 to January 2007.  A modified BARRUERS Scale and a Facilitators Scale were used. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, rank transformation test, and multiple linear regression. 



Results
Barriers related to the setting subscale were more influential than barriers related to other subscales. The lack of authority was ranked as the top greatest barrier (15.7%), followed by the lack of time (13.4%) and language barrier (15.0%). Additional barriers identified were the reluctance of patients to research utilization, the lack of funding, and the lack of legal protection. The top three greatest facilitators were enhancing managerial support (36.9%), advancing education to increase knowledge base (21.1%), and increasing time for reviewing and implementing (17.5%), while cooperation of patients to research utilization, establishing a panel to evaluate researches, and funding were listed as additional facilitators. Hospital, educational background, research experience, and knowledge on evidence-based nursing were the factors influencing perceptions of the barriers and facilitators.



Conclusions
Nurses in China are facing a number of significant barriers in research utilization. Enhancing managerial support might be the most promising facilitator, given Chinese traditional culture and existing health care system. Hospital, educational background, research experience and knowledge on evidence-based nursing should be taken into account to promote research utilization. The BARRIERS Scale should consider funding and involvement of patients in research utilization.",14,"['were adopted', 'were recruited', 'were used', 'were analyzed', 'was ranked', 'followed by the lack of time', 'were listed', 'should be taken']",8,7,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081908,Barriers to and Facilitators of Research Utilization: A Survey of Registered Nurses in China

Aims
To aid public health policymaking, we studied the cost-effectiveness of buprenorphine, naltrexone, and placebo interventions for heroin dependence in Malaysia.



Design
We estimated the cost-effectiveness ratios of three treatments for heroin dependence. We used a microcosting methodology to determine fixed, variable, and societal costs of each intervention. Cost data were collected from investigators, staff, and project records on the number and type of resources used and unit costs; societal costs for participants’ time were estimated using Malaysia’s minimum wage. Costs were estimated from a provider and societal perspective and reported in 2004 US dollars.



Setting
Muar, Malaysia.



Participants
126 patients enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in Malaysia (2003–2005) receiving counseling and buprenorphine, naltrexone, or placebo for treatment of heroin dependence.



Measurements
Primary outcome measures included days in treatment, maximum consecutive days of heroin abstinence, days to first heroin use, and days to heroin relapse. Secondary outcome measures included treatment retention, injection drug use, illicit opiate use, AIDS Risk Inventory total score, and drug risk and sex risk subscores.



Findings
Buprenorphine was more effective and more costly than naltrexone for all primary and most secondary outcomes. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were below $50 for primary outcomes, mostly below $350 for secondary outcomes. Naltrexone was dominated by placebo for all secondary outcomes at almost all endpoints. Incremental treatment costs were driven mainly by medication costs, especially the price of buprenorphine.



Conclusions
Buprenorphine appears to be a cost-effective alternative to naltrexone that might enhance economic productivity and reduce drug use over a longer term.",16,"['were collected', 'were estimated', 'were estimated', 'was dominated', 'were driven']",5,4,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050673,Cost-Effectiveness of Buprenorphine and Naltrexone Treatments for Heroin Dependence in Malaysia

Aims
To analyse whether gender inequality in the couple relationship was related to leisure-based physical activity, after controlling for earlier physical activity and confounders.



Methods
Data drawn from the Northern Swedish Cohort of all pupils in their final year of compulsory schooling in a town in the North of Sweden. The sample consisted of 772 respondents (n = 381 men, n = 391 women) in the 26-year follow-up (in 2007, aged 42) who were either married or cohabiting. Ordinal regression, for men and women separately, was used to assess the association between gender inequality (measured as self-perceived equality in the couple relationship using dummy variables) and a measure of exercise frequency, controlling for prior exercise frequency, socioeconomic status, the presence of children in the home, and longer than usual hours in paid work.



Results
The perception of greater gender equality in the couple relationship was associated with higher levels of physical activity for both men and women. This remained significant when the other variables were controlled for. Amongst men the confidence intervals were high.



Conclusions
The results point to the potential of perceived gender equality in the couple relationship to counteract the general time poverty and household burden that often arises from the combination of paid work and responsibility for children and the home, especially for women. The high confidence intervals among men indicate the need for more research within the field with larger samples.",9,"['was related', 'data drawn', 'was used', 'were controlled']",4,4,0.4444444444444444,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133348,Gender Inequality in the Couple Relationship and Leisure-Based Physical Exercise

Aims
To assess feasibility, acceptability, and early efficacy of monetary incentive-based interventions on fostering oral hygiene in young children measured with a Bluetooth-enabled toothbrush and smartphone application.



Design
A stratified, parallel-group, three-arm individually randomized controlled pilot trial.



Setting
Two Los Angeles area Early Head Start (EHS) sites.



Participants
36 parent-child dyads enrolled in an EHS home visit program for 0–3 year olds.



Interventions
Eligible dyads, within strata and permuted blocks, were randomized in equal allocation to one of three groups: waitlist (delayed monetary incentive) control group, fixed monetary incentive package, or lottery monetary incentive package. The intervention lasted 8 weeks.



Outcomes
Primary outcomes were a) toothbrushing performance: mean number of Bluetooth-recorded half-day episodes per week when the child’s teeth were brushed, and b) dental visit by the 2-month follow-up among children with no prior dental visit. The a priori milestone of 20% more frequent toothbrushing identified the intervention for a subsequent trial. Feasibility and acceptability measures were also assessed, including frequency of parents syncing the Bluetooth-enabled toothbrush to the smartphone application and plaque measurement from digital photographs.



Findings
Digital monitoring of toothbrushing was feasible. Mean number of weekly toothbrushing episodes over 8 weeks was 3.9 in the control group, 4.1 in the fixed incentive group, and 6.0 in the lottery incentive group. The lottery group had 53% more frequent toothbrushing than the control group and 47% more frequent toothbrushing than the fixed group. Exploratory analyses showed effects concentrated among children ≤24 months. Follow-up dental visit attendance was similar across groups. iPhone 7 more reliably captured evaluable images than Photomed Cannon G16.



Conclusions
Trial protocol and outcome measures were deemed feasible and acceptable. Results informed the study protocol for a fully powered trial of lottery incentives versus a delayed control using the smart toothbrush and remote digital incentive program administration.

Aims
To assess the associations between types of cannabis control policies at country level and prevalence of adolescent cannabis use.



Setting, Participants and Design
Multilevel logistic regressions were performed on 172,894 adolescents 15 year of age who participated in the 2001/2002, 2005/2006, or 2009/2010 cross-sectional Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) survey in 38 European and North American countries.



Measures
Self-reported cannabis use status was classified into ever use in life time, use in past year, and regular use. Country-level cannabis control policies were categorized into a dichotomous measure (whether or not liberalized) as well as 4 detailed types (full prohibition, depenalization, decriminalization, and partial prohibition). Control variables included individual-level sociodemographic characteristics and country-level economic characteristics.



Findings
Considerable intra-class correlations (.15-.19) were found at country level. With respect to the dichotomized cannabis control policy, adolescents were more likely to ever use cannabis (odds ratio (OR) = 1.10, p = .001), use in past year (OR = 1.09, p = .007), and use regularly (OR = 1.26, p = .004). Although boys were substantially more likely to use cannabis, the correlation between cannabis liberalization and cannabis use was smaller in boys than in girls. With respect to detailed types of policies, depenalization was associated with higher odds of past-year use (OR = 1.14, p = .013) and regular use (OR = 1.23, p = .038), and partial prohibition was associated with higher odds of regular use (OR = 2.39, p = .016). The correlation between cannabis liberalization and regular use was only significant after the policy had been introduced for more than 5 years.



Conclusions
Cannabis liberalization with depenalization and partial prohibition policies was associated with higher levels of regular cannabis use among adolescents. The correlations were heterogeneous between genders and between short- and long-terms.",12,"['were performed', 'was classified', 'were categorized', 'were found', 'had been introduced']",5,5,0.4166666666666667,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0143562,Cannabis Liberalization and Adolescent Cannabis Use: A Cross-National Study in 38 Countries

Aims
To assess the impact of an oral healthcare program in nursing homes on the initial treatment backlog and residents’ oral health stability.



Materials and methods
The study is a longitudinal cohort study in nursing home residents in Flanders, Belgium, to evaluate the oral healthcare programme Gerodent. The program consisted of: (1) the introduction of an oral healthcare team, (2) oral health education, (3) the implementation of oral health guidelines and protocols, and (4) regular visits of a mobile dental team. Data were extracted from the oral health records of 381 residents from 21 nursing homes who received treatments from the mobile dental team between October 2010 and March 2014 (mean follow-up period of 22.5 months). Oral health and treatment need between baseline and follow-up were compared.



Results
The mean age at baseline was 82.4 years and the mean number of consultations per resident was 3.61 during the follow-up period. The proportion of residents with an oral treatment need was reduced from 65.9% to 31.3%. Among residents with natural teeth, there was significantly lower prevalence of caries (from 70.5% at baseline to 36.5% at follow-up; p<0.001), residual roots (from 54.2% to 25.1%; p<0.001), and need for fillings (from 31.9% to 17.1%; p<0.001) or extractions (from 64.3% to 31.6%; p<0.001). In the group with partial or full dentures (n = 223), 38.1% needed a repair, rebasing or renewal of their existing dentures at baseline and the respective figure at follow-up was 9.0% (p<0.001). In terms of oral health stability, 53% of the residents had no incident restorative and prosthetic treatment need throughout the follow-up period. A lower number of natural teeth at baseline (p<0.001) and a shorter follow-up period (p = 0.002) were associated with higher chances of oral health stability.



Conclusion
The oral healthcare program Gerodent significantly reduced the treatment backlog and contributed to a considerable proportion of residents being stable in terms of oral health without any incident treatment needs.",12,"['were extracted', 'were compared', 'was reduced']",3,3,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198910,The impact of a preventive and curative oral healthcare program on the prevalence and incidence of oral health problems in nursing home residents

Aims
To contribute new evidence to the controversy about the factor structure of the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and to provide, for the first time, norms based on a large adolescent Mexican community sample, regarding sex and area of residence (urban/rural). 



Methods
A total of 2928 schoolchildren (1544 females and 1384 males) aged 11-18 were assessed with the EDE-Q and other disordered eating questionnaire measures.



Results
Confirmatory factor analysis of the attitudinal items of the EDE-Q did not support the four theorized subscales, and a two-factor solution, Restraint and Eating-Shape-Weight concern, showed better fit than the other models examined (RMSEA = .054); measurement invariance for this two-factor model across sex and area of residence was found. Satisfactory internal consistency (ω ≥ .80) and two-week test-retest reliability (ICCa ≥ .84; κ ≥ .56), and evidence for convergent validity with external measures was obtained. The highest attitudinal EDE-Q scores were found for urban females and the lowest scores were found for rural males, whereas the occurrence of key eating disorder behavioural features and compensatory behaviours was similar in both areas of residence. 



Conclusions
This study reveals satisfactory psychometric properties and provides population norms of the EDE-Q, which may help clinicians and researchers to interpret the EDE-Q scores of adolescents from urban and rural areas in Mexico.",6,"['were assessed', 'was found', 'was obtained', 'were found', 'were found']",5,4,0.6666666666666666,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0083245,Psychometric Properties of the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and Norms for Rural and Urban Adolescent Males and Females in Mexico
"Abstract

Aims
To describe the prevalence and severity of mental disorders and to examine differences in risk among those with and without a lifetime history prior to a moderate magnitude earthquake that took place in Lorca (Murcia, Spain) at roughly the mid-point (on May 11, 2011) of the time interval in which a regional epidemiological survey was already being carried out (June 2010 –May 2012).



Methods
The PEGASUS-Murcia project is a cross-sectional face-to-face interview survey of a representative sample of non-institutionalized adults in Murcia. Main outcome measures are prevalence and severity of anxiety, mood, impulse and substance disorders in the 12 months previous to the survey, assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0). Sociodemographic variables, prior history of any mental disorder and earthquake-related stressors were entered as independent variables in a logistic regression analysis.



Findings
A total number of 412 participants (response rate: 71%) were interviewed. Significant differences in 12-month prevalence of mental disorders were found in Lorca compared to the rest of Murcia for any (12.8% vs 16.8%), PTSD (3.6% vs 0.5%) and other anxiety disorders (5.3% vs 9.2%) (p≤ 0.05 for all). No differences were found for 12-month prevalence of any mood or any substance disorder. The two major predictors for developing a 12-month post-earthquake mental disorder were a prior mental disorder and the level of exposure. Other risk factors included female sex and low-average income.



Conclusions
PTSD and other mental disorders are commonly associated with earthquake disasters. Prior mental disorders and the level of exposure to the earthquakes are the most important for the development of a consequent mental disorder and this recognition may help to identify those individuals that may most benefit from specific therapeutic intervention.",11,"['being carried', 'were entered', 'were interviewed', 'were found', 'were found']",5,5,0.45454545454545453,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179690,"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and other mental disorders in the general population after Lorca’s earthquakes, 2011 (Murcia, Spain): A cross-sectional study"
"Abstract

Aims
To describe trends in the incidence of non-traumatic amputations among people with and without diabetes and estimate the relative risk of an individual with diabetes undergoing a lower extremity amputation compared to an individual without diabetes in the Republic of Ireland.



Methods
All adults who underwent a nontraumatic amputation during 2005 to 2009 were identified using HIPE (Hospital In-patient Enquiry) data. Participants were classified as having diabetes or not having diabetes. Incidence rates were calculated using the number of discharges for diabetes and non-diabetes related lower extremity amputations as the numerator and estimates of the resident population with and without diabetes as the denominator. Age-adjusted incidence rates were used for trend analysis.



Results
Total diabetes-related amputation rates increased non-significantly during the study period; 144.2 in 2005 to 175.7 in 2009 per 100,000 people with diabetes (p = 0.11). Total non-diabetes related amputation rates dropped non-significantly from 12.0 in 2005 to 9.2 in 2009 per 100,000 people without diabetes (p = 0.16). An individual with diabetes was 22.3 (95% CI 19.1–26.1) times more likely to undergo a nontraumatic amputation than an individual without diabetes in 2005 and this did not change significantly by 2009.



Discussion
This study provides the first national estimate of lower extremity amputation rates in the Republic of Ireland. Diabetes-related amputation rates have remained steady despite an increase in people with diabetes. These estimates provide a base-line and will allow follow-up over time.",11,"['were identified', 'were classified', 'were calculated', 'were used']",4,4,0.36363636363636365,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0041492,Trends in the Incidence of Lower Extremity Amputations in People with and without Diabetes over a Five-Year Period in the Republic of Ireland

Aims
To determine the cost and quality of life impact imposed by glaucoma in Tanzania, East Africa.



Methods
An expert panel of eye health professionals was convened to agree current glaucoma practice in Tanzania. In addition a structured patient survey was developed and administered. Supplemental cost and quality of life information was collected using cost questionnaires and validated quality of life measures, including the EQ5D and VFQ-25.



Results
Key findings include following. Non-adherence is a major issue, especially in rural settings where over 50% of the patients may fail to return for review. Whilst medical therapy is overwhelmingly the first line treatment, the cost of maintaining this represents up to 25% of a patient’s income. There is an impact of glaucoma on patients general well-being as determined by the EQ-5D and more tellingly on visual function with particular impact on role limitations as determined by the VF25. Despite our sample being taken in a private clinic and thus containing a much larger proportion of professionals than the general population, one third of the population earned Tanzanian Shillings (TZS) 170,000 per month which is below the minimum wage.



Conclusion
These findings are of great importance for health care planners seeking to determine cost-effective, acceptable methods of both identifying and treating this major cause of preventable blindness.",10,"['was convened', 'was developed and administered.', 'was collected', 'being as determined', 'determined by the vf25', 'being taken']",6,5,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0232796,The cost and quality of life impact of glaucoma in Tanzania: An observational study

Aims
To determine the diagnostic performance of macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) for glaucoma detection in a Chinese population in comparison with optic nerve head (ONH) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) parameters measured by both SD-OCT and Heidelberg Retina Tomography 3 (HRT-3).



Methods
Adults aged 40 to 80 years were recruited from the population-based study (n = 3353, response rate 72.8%). Macular cube 200x200 scan was performed with Cirrus SD-OCT (version 6.0, Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc, Dublin, CA) for GCIPL thickness measurement. ONH and RNFL imaging was performed with Cirrus SD-OCT and HRT-3 (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). Glaucoma was defined according to International Society for Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology criteria.



Results
In total, 86 eyes of 60 subjects with glaucoma and 1709 eyes of 1001 non-glaucoma participants were included. The best performing parameters for Cirrus SD-OCT GCIPL, Cirrus SD-OCT ONH and HRT-3 were minimum GCIPL thickness (Area under receiver-operating curve [AUC] = 0.89, 95% CI 0.83–0.95), vertical cup-disc ratio (CDR) (AUC = 0.94, 0.91–0.98) and vertical CDR (AUC = 0.86, 0.81–0.92), respectively. At 85% specificity, vertical CDR measured using Cirrus OCT ONH scan showed the highest sensitivity (88.64%, 95% CI 75.4–96.2) compared to minimum GCIPL thickness with sensitivity of 60.53% (95% CI 46.4–73.0) (p<0.001). Inferior RNFL thickness (AUC = 0.84, 95% CI 0.91–0.97) measured by Cirrus SD-OCT was also superior to Cirrus SD-OCT GCIPL (p<0.007).



Conclusions
The diagnostic performance of macular GCIPL scan is inferior compared to vertical CDR measured by Cirrus OCT ONH scan. Cirrus OCT ONH scan showed the best ability in detecting glaucoma in a Chinese population, suggesting it could be a good glaucoma screening tool in an Asian population.",11,"['parameters measured', 'adults aged', 'were recruited', 'was performed', 'was performed', 'was defined', 'were included']",7,6,0.5454545454545454,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0199134,Diagnostic accuracy of macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness for glaucoma detection in a population-based study: Comparison with optic nerve head imaging parameters

Aims
To determine the prevalence of temporomandibular disorders and associated factors in an adolescent sample from Recife, Brazil.



Materials and methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted with 1342 adolescents aged 10–17 years. The Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD) was used by calibrated examiners to evaluate the presence and levels of chronic pain. To evaluate the socioeconomic conditions, the subjects answered the Brazilian Economic Classification Criteria (CCEB) questionnaire. Data were analyzed by means of binary logistic regression in SPSS.



Results
The results showed that 33.2% of the subjects had TMD irrespective of age (p = 0.153) or economic class (p = 0.653). Statistically significant associations were found between TMD and female gender (p = 0.017), headache/migraine in the past six months (p<0.001), chronic pain (p<0.001) and chronic pain level (p<0.001). In the final model, logistic regression showed that the level of chronic pain and the headache/migraine in the past six months were related to the presence of TMD.



Conclusions
The prevalence of TMD was considered high (33.2%) and adolescents with chronic pain and headache in the past six months were more likely to have TMD.



Clinical relevance
The data contribute to the understanding of TMD among adolescents and to the development of preventive measures and polices to identify the dysfunction promptly.",10,"['was conducted', 'was used', 'were analyzed', 'were found', 'were related', 'was considered']",6,6,0.6,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0205874,Prevalence of TMD and level of chronic pain in a group of Brazilian adolescents

Aims
To determine whether a serine protease inhibitor treatment can prevent or minimize emphysema in mice.



Methods
C57BL/6 mice were subjected to porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) nasal instillation to induce emphysema and were treated with a serine protease inhibitor (rBmTI-A) before (Protocol 1) and after (Protocol 2) emphysema development. In both protocols, we evaluated lung function to evaluate the airway resistance (Raw), tissue damping (Gtis) and tissue elastance (Htis). The inflammatory profile was analyzed in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BALF) and through the use of morphometry; we measured the mean linear intercept (Lm) (to verify alveolar enlargement), the volume proportion of collagen and elastic fibers, and the numbers of macrophages and metalloprotease 12 (MMP-12) positive cells in the parenchyma. We showed that at both time points, even after the emphysema was established, the rBmTI-A treatment was sufficient to reverse the loss of elastic recoil measured by Htis, the alveolar enlargement and the increase in the total number of cells in the BALF, with a primary decrease in the number of macrophages. Although, the treatment did not control the increase in macrophages in the lung parenchyma, it was sufficient to decrease the number of positive cells for MMP-12 and reduce the volume of collagen fibers, which was increased in PPE groups. These findings attest to the importance of MMP-12 in PPE-induced emphysema and suggest that this metalloprotease could be an effective therapeutic target.",7,"['were subjected', 'were treated', 'was analyzed', 'was established', 'was increased']",5,4,0.5714285714285714,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098216,A Treatment with a Protease Inhibitor Recombinant from the Cattle Tick (Rhipicephalus Boophilus microplus) Ameliorates Emphysema in Mice
"Abstract

Aims
To determine whether the self-reported personal wellbeing of a cohort of people who inject drugs (PWID) changes over time, and to identify longitudinal correlates of change.



Methods
We used Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI) scores reported between April 2008 and February 2015 by 757 PWID (66% male) enrolled in the Melbourne Injecting Drug Use Cohort Study (2,862 interviews; up to seven follow-up waves). A mixed-effects model was used to identify correlations between changes in temporal variables and changes in individual PWI scores while controlling for demographic variables.



Results
The cohort’s mean PWI score did not significantly differ over time (between 54.4/100 and 56.7/100 across the first four interview waves), and was 25–28% lower than general Australian population scores (76.0/100). However, there were large variations in individuals’ PWI scores between interviews. Increased psychological distress, moving into unstable accommodation, reporting intentional overdose in the past 12 months and being the victim of assault in the past six months were associated with declines in PWI scores.



Conclusions
Participants experienced substantially lower levels of personal wellbeing than the general Australian population, influenced by experiences of psychological distress, assault, overdose and harms related to low socioeconomic status. The results of this study suggest a need to ensure referral to appropriate housing and health support services for PWID.",9,['was used'],1,1,0.1111111111111111,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0178474,Longitudinal changes in personal wellbeing in a cohort of people who inject drugs

Aims
To develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of a Chinese Feeding Difficulty Index (Ch-FDI) which assesses feeding difficulties in people with dementia (PwD).



Research Design and Method
Scale items were developed using literature review based on Model of Feeding Difficulty. Content validity was evaluated and items were modified by expert panel. Following translation and back-translation, the Ch-FDI was piloted on residents with dementia. The reliability was tested by inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability. Internal reliability was established by calculating Cronbach's α coefficient. The concurrent validity was evaluated by correlating with similar scale, the Edinburgh Feeding Evaluation in Dementia (EdFED). The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with varimax rotation and parallel analysis (PA) was performed to test construct validity.



Method
Participants were recruited from long-term care facilities in Taiwan. A total of 213 residents with dementia participated in this study during May, 2010 to February, 2011.



Results
Content validation, translation and psychometric testing were completed on the 19 items of the Ch-FDI. The translated scale was piloted on 213 residents with dementia of feeding difficulty who were recruited from eight long-term care facilities in Taiwan. The reliability was supported by the internal consistency of Cronbach's α of 0.68 and a test-retest coefficient of 0.85. The content validity, face validity, concurrent validity, and construct validity were used.



Conclusions
The Ch-FDI is a newly developed scale with fair psychometric properties aimed to measure feeding difficulties among residents with dementia in long-term care facilities in Taiwan. Using this reliable and valid tool can help healthcare providers to assess feeding problems of PwD and provide feeding assistance in order to promote quality of care during mealtime in long-term care facilities.",15,"['were developed', 'was evaluated', 'were modified', 'was piloted', 'was tested', 'was established', 'was evaluated', 'was performed', 'were recruited', 'were completed', 'was piloted', 'were recruited', 'was supported', 'were used']",14,12,0.8,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133716,Development and Psychometric Evaluation of the Chinese Feeding Difficulty Index (Ch-FDI) for People with Dementia

Aims
To develop clinical descriptions (vignettes) of life with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we conducted focus groups of persons with AD (n = 14), family caregivers of persons with AD (n = 20), and clinicians who see persons with AD in their practices (n = 5).



Methods
Group participants read existing descriptions of AD and commented on the realism and comprehensibility of the descriptions. We used thematic framework analysis to code the comments into themes and develop three new vignettes to describe mild, moderate, and severe AD.



Results
Themes included the types of symptoms to mention in the new vignettes, plus the manner in which the vignettes should be written. Since the vignette descriptions were based on focus group participants’ first-hand knowledge of AD, the descriptions can be said to demonstrate content validity.



Conclusion
Members of the general public can read the vignettes and estimate their health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) as if they had AD based on the vignette descriptions. This is especially important for economic evaluations of new AD medications, which require HRQoL to be assessed in a manner that persons with AD often find difficult to undertake. The vignettes will allow the general public to serve as a proxy and provide HRQoL estimates in place of persons with AD.",8,"['should be written', 'can be said', 'be assessed']",3,3,0.375,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162422,Development of Clinical Vignettes to Describe Alzheimer's Disease Health States: A Qualitative Study

Aims
To engage with high risk groups to identify knowledge and awareness of oral cancer signs and symptoms and the factors likely to contribute to improved screening uptake.



Methods
Focus group discussions were undertaken with 18 males; 40+ years of age; smokers and/or drinkers (15+ cigarettes per day and/or 15+ units of alcohol per week), irregular dental attenders living in economically deprived areas of Teesside.



Results
There was a striking reported lack of knowledge and awareness of oral cancer and its signs and symptoms among the participants. When oral/mouth cancer leaflets produced by Cancer Research UK were presented to the participants, they claimed that they would seek help on noticing such a condition. There was a preference to seek help from their general practitioner rather than their dentist due to perceptions that a dentist is ‘inaccessible’ on a physical and psychological level, costly, a ‘tooth specialist’ not a ‘mouth specialist’, and also not able to prescribe medication and make referrals to specialists. Interestingly, none of the 18 participants who were offered a free oral cancer examination at a dental practice took up this offer.



Conclusions
The uptake of oral cancer screening may be improved by increasing knowledge of the existence and signs and symptoms of oral cancer. Other factors that may increase uptake are increased awareness of the role of dentists in diagnosing oral cancer, promotion of oral cancer screening by health professionals during routine health checks, and the use of a “health” screening setting as opposed to a “dental” setting for such checks.",8,"['were undertaken', 'leaflets produced', 'were presented', 'were offered', 'may be improved', 'are increased']",6,5,0.625,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0047410,Identifying Factors to Improve Oral Cancer Screening Uptake: A Qualitative Study

Aims
To establish a thematic framework for a Diabetes Mellitus (DM)-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) item bank by identifying important HRQoL themes and content gaps in existing DM-specific HRQoL measures and determining whether Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) item banks are useful as a starting point.



Methodology
English-speaking Type 2 DM patients were recruited from an outpatient specialist clinic in Singapore. Thematic analysis was performed through open coding and axial coding. Items from four existing DM-specific measures and PROMIS Version 1.0 and 2.0 item banks were compared with identified themes and sub-themes.



Results
42 patients participated (25 men and 17 women; 28 Chinese, 4 Malay, 8 Indians, 2 other ethnicities). Median age was 53.70 years (IQR45.82–56.97) and the median disease duration was 11.13 (SD9.77) years. 10 subthemes (neutral emotions, coping emotions, empowered to help others, support from family, spend more time with family, relationships, financial burden on family, improved relationship, social support and religion/spirituality) were not covered by existing DM-specific measures. PROMIS covered 5 of 6 themes, 15 of 30 subthemes and 19 of 35 codes identified. Emotional distress (frustration, fear and anxiety) was most frequently mentioned (200 times).



Conclusions
We had developed a thematic framework for assessing DM-specific HRQoL in a multi-ethnic Asian population, identified new items that needed to be written and confirmed that PROMIS was a useful starting point. We hope that better understanding and measurement of HRQoL of Asian DM patients will translate to better quality of care for them.",12,"['were recruited', 'was performed', 'were compared', 'were not covered', 'be written']",5,5,0.4166666666666667,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115654,Establishing the Thematic Framework for a Diabetes-Specific Health-Related Quality of Life Item Bank for Use in an English-Speaking Asian Population

Aims
To estimate the number of coronary heart disease (CHD) deaths potentially preventable in England in 2020 comparing four risk factor change scenarios.



Methods and Results
Using 2007 as baseline, the IMPACTSEC model was extended to estimate the potential number of CHD deaths preventable in England in 2020 by age, gender and Index of Multiple Deprivation 2007 quintiles given four risk factor change scenarios: (a) assuming recent trends will continue; (b) assuming optimal but feasible levels already achieved elsewhere; (c) an intermediate point, halfway between current and optimal levels; and (d) assuming plateauing or worsening levels, the worst case scenario. These four scenarios were compared to the baseline scenario with both risk factors and CHD mortality rates remaining at 2007 levels. This would result in approximately 97,000 CHD deaths in 2020. Assuming recent trends will continue would avert approximately 22,640 deaths (95% uncertainty interval: 20,390-24,980). There would be some 39,720 (37,120-41,900) fewer deaths in 2020 with optimal risk factor levels and 22,330 fewer (19,850-24,300) in the intermediate scenario. In the worst case scenario, 16,170 additional deaths (13,880-18,420) would occur. If optimal risk factor levels were achieved, the gap in CHD rates between the most and least deprived areas would halve with falls in systolic blood pressure, physical inactivity and total cholesterol providing the largest contributions to mortality gains.



Conclusions
CHD mortality reductions of up to 45%, accompanied by significant reductions in area deprivation mortality disparities, would be possible by implementing optimal preventive policies.",8,"['was extended', 'quintiles given', 'were compared', 'were achieved']",4,3,0.375,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0069935,Quantifying Policy Options for Reducing Future Coronary Heart Disease Mortality in England: A Modelling Study

Aims
To evaluate the effects of an outpatient multidisciplinary weight loss intervention in reducing body mass index (BMI) in children and adolescents suffering overweight and obesity, changes in A Body Shape Index (ABSI, waist circumference normalized to height and weight) and Hip Index (HI, normalized hip circumference) during treatment and correlation between the ABSI and HI with change in BMI z score.



Methods
We analyze anthropometric data from pediatric patients affected by overweight and obesity aged 2 to 18 years old who entered our multidisciplinary weight loss intervention, which included medical, psychological and nutritional sessions, from January 1st 2006 to December 31st 2016. Lifestyle modification counselling was delivered. Follow-up visits were planned every month for 3 months and subsequently every 2–4 months. BMI, ABSI, and HI were converted to z scores using age and sex specific population normals.

864 patients entered our intervention. 453 patients (208 males), mean age 11.2 ±3.1 years, 392 with obesity (86%, z-BMI 2.90 ±0.80 SD) and 61 patients with overweight (z-BMI 1.73±0.21 SD) attended at least 1 follow-up visit. The mean number of visits was 3.5 (± 1.8 SD) in overweight subjects and 3.9 (±2.2 SD) in ones with obesity. At the last attended follow-up visit (at 16 ± 12 months SD) we observed a reduction in mean z-BMI in patients with obesity (to 2.52 ±0.71 SD) and patients with overweight (to 1.46 ±0.5 SD). Most patients (80.8%) reduced their BMI z scores. Mean ABSI and HI z scores showed no significant change. 78/392 patients (19.8%) recovered from obese to overweight, 5/392 (1.2%) from obese to normal weight. The recovery rate from overweight to normal weight was 13.1%. In a multivariate model, initial BMI z score and number of follow-up visits were significant predictors of weight change, while age, sex, ABSI, and HI were not significant predictors.



Conclusions
Patients affected by overweight and obesity involved in a multidisciplinary weight loss intervention reduced their mean BMI z score, while ABSI and HI were stable. Weight loss was not predicted by initial ABSI or HI. More visits predict more weight loss, but dropout rates are high. The great majority of patients leave the weight management program before having normalized their BMI.",18,"['circumference normalized', 'was delivered', 'were planned', 'were converted', 'patients affected', 'was not predicted']",6,6,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181095,Effects of a multidisciplinary weight loss intervention in overweight and obese children and adolescents: 11 years of experience
"Abstract

Aims
To evaluate the immediate and six-month effectiveness of a group-based self-management support program for people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (1–3 years post diagnosis) on diabetes self-care, distress and cognitions.



Methods
People with type 2 diabetes were randomized into the intervention (four group-based interactive sessions) or the control group (a single educational lecture) with their partners. Outcomes were measured at baseline, immediately after the third course session and six months later using validated questionnaires on diabetes self-care, distress, illness perceptions, diabetes-related attitudes, empowerment and partner support. Multilevel analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle using the data from 82 intervention and 86 control group participants, to test for differences in changes over time between the two groups.



Results
The intervention group showed a significantly higher increase in physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake immediately after the program, whereas the low baseline levels of diabetes distress remained unaffected. Furthermore, the intervention group believed their illness to be more likely to be caused by chance/bad luck, but also felt more empowered to handle their condition and its treatment immediately after the program compared with the control group. Six months later, only the differences in empowerment had persisted.



Conclusions
Group-based self-management support results in favorable short-term behavioral changes and more persistent alterations in (perceived) empowerment in people living in the first years of type 2 diabetes. In order to achieve more sustainable behavioral changes, more prolonged support is necessary. This could be achieved by integrating attention to patients’ illness perceptions and continuous self-management support in regular diabetes care.

"Abstract

Aims
To evaluate the relative efficiencies of five Internet-based digital and three paper-based scientific surveys and to estimate the costs for different-sized cohorts.



Methods
Invitations to participate in a survey were distributed via e-mail to employees of two university hospitals (E1 and E2) and to members of a medical association (E3), as a link placed in a special text on the municipal homepage regularly read by the administrative employees of two cities (H1 and H2), and paper-based to workers at an automobile enterprise (P1) and college (P2) and senior (P3) students. The main parameters analyzed included the numbers of invited and actual participants, and the time and cost to complete the survey. Statistical analysis was descriptive, except for the Kruskal-Wallis-H-test, which was used to compare the three recruitment methods. Cost efficiencies were compared and extrapolated to different-sized cohorts.



Results
The ratios of completely answered questionnaires to distributed questionnaires were between 81.5% (E1) and 97.4% (P2). Between 6.4% (P1) and 57.0% (P2) of the invited participants completely answered the questionnaires. The costs per completely answered questionnaire were $0.57–$1.41 (E1–3), $1.70 and $0.80 for H1 and H2, respectively, and $3.36–$4.21 (P1–3). Based on our results, electronic surveys with 10, 20, 30, or 42 questions would be estimated to be most cost (and time) efficient if more than 101.6–225.9 (128.2–391.7), 139.8–229.2 (93.8–193.6), 165.8–230.6 (68.7–115.7), or 188.2–231.5 (44.4–72.7) participants were required, respectively.



Conclusions
The study efficiency depended on the technical modalities of the survey methods and engagement of the participants. Depending on our study design, our results suggest that in similar projects that will certainly have more than two to three hundred required participants, the most efficient way of conducting a questionnaire-based survey is likely via the Internet with a digital questionnaire, specifically via a centralized e-mail.",11,"['were distributed', 'was used', 'were compared and extrapolated to', 'would be estimated', 'were required']",5,4,0.36363636363636365,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0108441,Efficiencies of Internet-Based Digital and Paper-Based Scientific Surveys and the Estimated Costs and Time for Different-Sized Cohorts

Aims
To evaluate vibrotactile perception at different frequencies in fingers and in foot in healthy girls and boys.



Methods
Vibration perception thresholds (VPTs) were measured in 283 healthy (8–20 years), consecutively included, girls (n=146) and boys (n=137); i.e., 269 children after excluding those with diseases or disorders possibly affecting the nervous system. Thresholds were measured in finger pulps of index and little fingers (seven frequencies; 8–500 Hz) and at first and fifth metatarsal head and at heel in the sole of the foot (six frequencies; 8–250 Hz;) using Multi Frequency Tactilometry.



Results
VPTs, divided in six groups by age and gender (i.e., 8–10 years, 11–15 years and 16–20 years), at all three sites in the sole increased with higher frequencies, but without gender differences. Thresholds at 64 and 125 Hz were generally higher at heel compared to metatarsal heads. VPTs in finger pulps of index and little fingers, with no finger differences, had a different pattern with increasing thresholds with frequency, but with lower thresholds at 64 and 125 Hz. Thresholds at lower frequencies were higher in finger pulps, while at higher frequencies VPTs were lower in finger pulps than in the sole of the foot; thus, vibration perception in the sole was better than perception in finger pulps at lower frequencies and opposite at higher frequencies. VPTs were higher among adolescents than in younger children in the foot, while thresholds were lower in the finger pulps among adolescents, particularly in index finger. Thresholds in finger pulps of index and little fingers, particularly at higher frequencies, correlated with each other, which the three sites in the sole also did.



Conclusions
VPTs in fingers and in feet are different as related to frequency in healthy girls and boys. Multi Frequency Tactilometry is a future valuable method to detect neuropathy in children and adolescents.",11,"['were measured', 'were measured']",2,2,0.18181818181818182,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0119753,Vibrotactile Perception in Finger Pulps and in the Sole of the Foot in Healthy Subjects among Children or Adolescents
"Abstract

Aims
To examine drug use behavior of clients attending Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) programs and its relationship with the clients’ social network characteristics.



Design
Cross-sectional study.



Setting
Four MMT clinics in Kunming, Yunnan province, China.



Participants
324 consecutive MMT clients.



Measurements
A structured, self-completed questionnaire on background characteristics and existing social network. Current drug use was assessed by urine test for opiate metabolites.



Analysis
The association between client's social network characteristics and their own current drug use behavior is analysed using multiple logistic regression adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are obtained to give the strength of the associations.



Findings
MMT clients were more likely to concurrently use heroin while attending MMT if their social network had any of the following characteristics: more than half of the members were older than them (AOR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.00,1.06), any member had a high level of influence on them (AOR = 6.47, 95% CI = 2.86,14.65) and any member joined them in using drugs (AOR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.04,3.63). Having a social network member who could provide emotional support (AOR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.03,0.35), having a spouse and/or child in their social network (AOR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.24,0.81) and having a social network member with a high level of closeness (AOR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.09,0.90) were associated with a decreased odds of heroin use.



Conclusion
Social networks who could provide MMT clients with emotional support and a close relationship were significant factors for reducing the risk of concurrent drug use among clients attending MMT clinics in Kunming, China. Behavioral interventions should address the role of family and social network members in providing support to these clients.",12,"['was assessed', 'is analysed', 'are obtained']",3,3,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0200105,"Influence of social network on drug use among clients of methadone maintenance treatment centers in Kunming, China"

Aims
To examine the relationship between baseline structural characteristics of the optic nerve head (ONH) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and functional disease progression in patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) over 5 years.



Methods
112 OAG patients were prospectively examined at baseline and every 6 months over a period of five years. Structural glaucomatous changes were examined with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Heidelberg retinal tomography-III (HRT-III), and functional disease progression with automated perimetry (Humphrey visual fields). Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the relationship between baseline structural measurements and functional disease progression.



Results
From baseline over a 5-year period, statistically significant increases were found in OCT disc (D) area (p<0.001), cup (C) area (p<0.001), C/D area ratio (p<0.001), C/D horizontal ratio (p<0.001), C/D vertical ratio (p = 0.018), and a decrease in superior RNFL thickness (p = 0.008). Statistically significant increases were found in HRT-III C volume (p = 0.021), C/D area ratio (p = 0.046), mean C depth (p = 0.036), C shape (p = 0.008), and height variation contour (p = 0.020). Functional disease progression was detected in 37 of the 112 patients (26 of European descent and 11 of African descent; 33%). A statistically significant shorter time to functional progression was seen in patients with larger baseline OCT D area (p = 0.008), C area (p = 0.003), thicker temporal RNFL (p = 0.003), and in patients with a larger HRT-III C area (p = 0.004), C/D area ratio (p = 0.004), linear C/D ratio (p = 0.007), C shape (p = 0.032), or smaller rim area (p = 0.039), rim volume (p = 0.005), height variation contour (p = 0.041), mean RNFL thickness (p<0.001), or RNFL cross-sectional area (p = 0.002).



Conclusion
Baseline ONH and RNFL structural characteristics were associated with a significantly shorter time to functional glaucomatous progression and visual field loss through the five-year period in OAG patients.",9,"['were prospectively examined', 'were examined', 'were used', 'were found', 'were found', 'was detected', 'was seen']",7,7,0.7777777777777778,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0236819,Baseline structural characteristics of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer are associated with progressive visual field loss in patients with open-angle glaucoma
"Abstract

Aims
To explore actions and motivations for self-management practices of Pacific adults following diagnosis of end stage renal disease (ESRD).



Methods
Focused ethnography using in-depth interviews with 16 Pacific people on haemodialysis for diabetic ESRD, in Auckland, New Zealand. Study participants were of Samoan, Cook Islander, Tongan, Niuean, or Tokelauan ethnicity and aged between 30 to 69 years old. Thematic analysis was used to code and identify emergent themes.



Results
All participants assumed active responsibility for their self-management following their diagnosis of ESRD. They reported positive differences in their current self-management behaviours, compared to pre-ESRD diagnosis. In the face of their terminal diagnosis, participant’s motivations to self-manage their health were fuelled by hope; the hope to live long enough to change their family legacy of diabetes and ESRD. To achieve this, there was a dependency upon family members as a resource for self-management support. Yet at the same time, family members also had health concerns (including diabetes), and several participants themselves were carers for sick or elderly family members.



Conclusion
The growing number of members (within family units) progressing from moderate to late-stage diabetes raises concerns about the sustainability of future family support in Pacific families in New Zealand with histories of diabetes, ESRD, and other chronic diseases. While the burden upon informal carers (family) has been well documented throughout the past few decades, the dynamics of bi-directional carer support between (two or more) sick family members and their families have had less exposure. This has potentially significant implications for Pacific peoples in New Zealand, considering the increases in diabetes prevalence within their families.",12,"['was used', 'were fuelled', 'has been well documented']",3,3,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0222642,Self-management action and motivation of Pacific adults in New Zealand with end-stage renal disease

Aims
To explore adolescents’ experiences of consenting to, and participating in, alcohol intervention trials when attending for emergency care.



Methods
In-depth semi-structured interviews with 27 adolescents (16 males; aged 14–17 years (Mage = 15.7)) who had taken part in one of two linked brief alcohol intervention trials based in 10 accident and emergency departments in England. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and subject to thematic analysis.



Results
Research and intervention methods were generally found to be acceptable though confidentiality was important and parental presence could hinder truthful disclosures regarding alcohol use. Participants discussed the importance of being involved in research that was relevant to them and recognised alcohol consumption as a normative part of adolescence, highlighting the importance of having access to appropriate health information. Beyond this, they recognised the benefits and risks of trial participation for themselves and others with the majority showing a degree of altruism in considering longer term implications for others as well as themselves.



Conclusions
Alcohol screening and intervention in emergency care is both acceptable and relevant to adolescents but acceptability is reliant on confidentiality being assured and may be inhibited by parental presence.

"Abstract

Aims
To explore and document the experiences and values of spouse caregivers of stroke survivors. To gain more in-depth knowledge of how the act of caring and the adaption process affects caregiving spouses.



Materials and methods
Phenomenological, qualitative study. This study included spouses of stroke survivors who also served as primary caregivers. Individual, semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted, transcribed, and analysed using a thematic content analysis as proposed by Giorgi. Data was analysed and managed using Atlas-ti (version 7.0). This study was approved by our institution´s Complejo Hospitalario de Caceres Ethics and Research Committee.



Results
Spouse caregivers of stroke survivors undergo a process of disruption in their private lives and relationships, marked by their caregiving duties. The experiences of spouses caring for stroke survivors is condensed into topics and subtopics: “Caregiving and that´s all” summarizes the sense of having no life horizons and also caregiver impossibility of moving away from caring role. Otherwise, “Breaking the couple´s life together” enlightens the further consequences of stroke in couples shared live biography, which needs to be understood and rebuilt. Finally, “Going through the (non) loss alone” alludes to how spouses reinterpret meaning of loss, which is not appreciated by others and that refers to the balance between stroke survival and any acquired global disability.



Conclusions
A comprehensive approach to the couple (family), from a psycho-socio-emotional and relational perspective, is essential for ensuring adequate quality of life for people who suffered a stroke as well as their caregivers. Spouses-caregivers must be considered as individuals living a transition process due to their unexpected disrupting change, which nurses should address through a comprehensive and integrated approach focused on transition care. Care resources must be adapted to the interpretation that the spouses have of their caregiving role and their relationship with the different components of the caregiving process.",14,"['were conducted', 'proposed by giorgi', 'was analysed and managed using', 'was approved', 'marked by their caregiving duties', 'is condensed', 'be understood', 'is not appreciated', 'must be considered', 'must be adapted']",10,9,0.6428571428571429,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195190,Critical points in the experience of spouse caregivers of patients who have suffered a stroke.

Aims
To identify predictors of early revision (within 3 years of the index operation) for hip and knee replacement (HR, KR) from both surgeon and population perspectives.



Patients and methods
Hierarchical logistic regression on national administrative data for England for index procedures between April 2009 and March 2014.



Results
There were 315,273 index HR procedures and 374,530 index KR procedures for analysis. Three-year revision rates were 2.1% for HR and 2.2% for KR. The highest odds ratios for HR were for 3+ previous emergency admissions, drug abuse, Parkinson’s disease, resurfacing and ages under 60; for KR these were patellofemoral or partial joint replacement, 3+ previous emergency admissions, paralysis and ages under 60. Smaller effects were found for other comorbidities such as obesity (HR) and diabetes (KR). From a population perspective, the only population attributable fractions over 5% were for male gender, uncemented total hip replacements and partial knee or patellofemoral replacements.



Conclusions
Meeting the rising demand for revision surgery is a challenge for healthcare leaders and policymakers. Our findings suggest optimising patients pre-operatively and improving patient selection for primary arthroplasty may reduce the burden of early revision of arthroplasty. Our study gives useful information on the additional risks of various comorbidities and procedures, which enables a more informed consent process.

Aims
To investigate an influence of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS)- and Morbus Fabry-associated corneal opacities on intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements and to evaluate the concordance of the different tonometry methods.



Methods
25 MPS patients with or without corneal clouding, 25 Fabry patients with cornea verticillata ≥ grade 2 and 25 healthy age matched controls were prospectively included into this study. Outcome measures: Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT); palpatory assessment of IOP; Goldmann-correlated intraocular pressure (IOPg), corneal-compensated intraocular pressure (IOPcc), corneal resistance factor (CRF) and corneal hysteresis (CH) assessed by Ocular Response Analyzer (ORA); central corneal thickness (CCT) and density assessed with Pentacam. Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed effect models and Spearman correlation coefficients. The concordance between tonometry methods was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis.



Results
There was no relevant difference between study groups regarding median GAT, IOPg, IOPcc and CCT measurements. The limits of agreement between GAT and IOPcc/IOPg/palpatory IOP in MPS were: [-11.7 to 12.1mmHg], [-8.6 to 15.5 mmHg] and [- 5.4 to 10.1 mmHg] respectively. Limits of agreement were less wide in healthy subjects and Fabry patients. Palpatory IOP was higher in MPS than in healthy controls and Fabry patients. Corneal opacity correlated more strongly with GAT, IOPg, CH, CRF, CCT and corneal density in MPS (r = 0.4, 0.5, 0.5, 0.7, 0.6, 0.6 respectively) than in Fabry patients (r = 0.3, 0.2, -0.03, 0.1, 0.3, -0.2 respectively). In contrast, IOPcc revealed less correlation with corneal opacity than GAT in MPS (r = 0.2 vs. 0.4).



Conclusions
ORA and GAT render less comparable IOP-values in patients suffering from MPS-associated corneal opacity in comparison to Fabry and healthy controls. The IOP seems to be overestimated in opaque MPS-affected corneas. GAT, IOPg and biomechanical parameters of the cornea correlate more strongly with the corneal clouding than IOPcc in MPS patients.

Aims
To investigate the association of demographic, clinical and psychosocial variables with levels of anxiety and depression in participants wearing an ocular prosthesis after eye enucleation.



Methods
This cross-sectional study included 195 participants with an enucleated eye who were attending an ophthalmic clinic for prosthetic rehabilitation between July and November 2014. Demographic and clinical data, and self-reported feelings of shame, sadness and anger were collected. Participants also completed the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire, the Facial Appearance subscale of the Negative Physical Self Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Regression models were used to identify the factors associated with anxiety and depression.



Results
The proportion of participants with clinical anxiety was 11.8% and clinical depression 13.8%. More anxiety and depression were associated with poorer vision-related quality of life and greater levels of appearance concerns. Younger age was related to greater levels of anxiety. Less educated participants and those feeling more angry about losing an eye are more prone to experience depression. Clinical variables were unrelated to anxiety or depression.



Conclusions
Anxiety and depression are more prevalent in eye-enucleated patients than the general population, which brings up the issues of psychiatric support in these patients. Psychosocial rather than clinical characteristics were associated with anxiety and depression. Longitudinal studies need to be conducted to further elucidate the direction of causality before interventions to improve mood states are developed.",13,"['were collected', 'were used', 'was related', 'be conducted', 'are developed']",5,4,0.3076923076923077,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136460,Vision-Related Quality of Life and Appearance Concerns Are Associated with Anxiety and Depression after Eye Enucleation: A Cross-Sectional Study

Aims
To investigate the feasibility and to compare three devices measuring intraocular pressure (IOP) in mucopolysaccharidosis patients (MPS): iCare rebound tonometer (RT), Perkins applanation tonometer (PAT) and ocular response analyzer (ORA)



Methods
MPS patients who underwent at least two examinations out of: RT, PAT and ORA at the same visit were identified and retrospectively analyzed in this study.



Results
17 patients fulfilled the inclusion criterion. In all 17 patients IOP measurements were performed with RT (34 eyes) and ORA (33 eyes), while PAT measurement was possible in only 12 (24 eyes) patients. The RT, corneal-compensated intraocular pressure (IOPcc) and Goldmann-correlated intraocular pressure (IOPg) differed relevantly from IOP assessed with PAT. Corneal clouding in MPS patients correlated positively with PAT, RT and IOPg (r = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.5 respectively), but not with IOPcc (r = 0.07). The MPS-related corneal clouding correlated positively with biomechanical corneal parameters assessed with ORA: corneal hysteresis (r = 0.77) and corneal resistance factor (r = 0.77) either.



Conclusions
RT and ORA measurements were tolerated better than applanation tonometry in MPS patients. IOP measurements assessed with RT and ORA differed relevantly from PAT. Corneal-compensated IOP assessed with ORA seems to be less affected by the MPS-related corneal clouding than applanation or rebound tonometry. RT and ORA measurements should be preferred for IOP assessment in patients with MPS.",10,"['were identified', 'were performed', 'were tolerated', 'should be preferred']",4,4,0.4,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133586,"Comparison of Rebound Tonometry, Perkins Applanation Tonometry and Ocular Response Analyser in Mucopolysaccharidosis Patients"

Aims
To investigate the mediating effects of normative beliefs of drug use on the effects of the #Tamojunto school-based prevention program (Unplugged).



Design
Secondary analysis of a cluster randomized controlled trial.



Setting
Brazil. Participants: A total of 6,391 adolescents (12.68 y.o) from 72 public schools in 6 Brazilian cities. Intervention: Schools were assigned to an experimental condition (#Tamojunto curriculum) or a control condition (no prevention program). Measurements: Baseline data were collected prior to program implementation, and follow-up data were collected 9 and 21 months later. The substances examined were alcohol (including binge drinking), tobacco, marijuana and inhalants. Five in-parallel mediation models evaluated whether the positive and negative beliefs were mediators of the likely effects of the intervention on drug use.



Findings
Lack of evidences regarding differences in normative beliefs or drug use were found between the intervention and control groups. However, there was a clear association between negative drug beliefs and lower consumption (i.e. OR = 0.78; 95% CI 0.70; 0.87, for cannabis use) as well as between positive drug beliefs and higher consumption (i.e. OR = 1.77; 95% CI 1.56; 2.02, for cannabis use) independent of the assigned group.



Conclusions
These results suggest that there is a lack of evidence that the program impact the normative beliefs, as proposed by the theoretical model of the program, suggesting that modifications are needed to produce the intended effect of the program. Negative normative beliefs seem to be a potential protective factor for drug use, but the program’s effect itself on drug use via normative beliefs was not found to be statistically significant. Program activities intended to affect normative beliefs should be improved.",13,"['were assigned', 'were collected', 'were collected', 'were found', 'proposed by the theoretical model of the program, suggesting that modifications are needed to produce the intended effect of the program', 'was not found', 'should be improved']",7,6,0.46153846153846156,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208072,The role of normative beliefs in the mediation of a school-based drug prevention program: A secondary analysis of the #Tamojunto cluster-randomized trial
"Abstract

Aims
To investigate the perceptions and reported practices of mental health hospital staff using national hospital electronic health records (EHRs) in order to inform future implementations, particularly in acute mental health settings.



Methods
Thematic analysis of interviews with a wide range of clinical, information technology (IT), managerial and other staff at two early adopter mental health National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in London, UK, implementing national EHRs.



Results
We analysed 33 interviews. We first sought out examples of workarounds, such as delayed data entry, entering data in wrong places and individuals using the EHR while logged in as a colleague, then identified possible reasons for the reported workarounds. Our analysis identified four main categories of factors contributing to workarounds (i.e., operational, cultural, organisational and technical). Operational factors included poor system integration with existing workflows and the system not meeting users' perceived needs. Cultural factors involved users' competence with IT and resistance to change. Organisational factors referred to insufficient organisational resources and training, while technical factors included inadequate local technical infrastructure. Many of these factors, such as integrating the EHR system with day-to-day operational processes, staff training and adequate local IT infrastructure, were likely to apply to system implementations in various settings, but we also identified factors that related particularly to implementing EHRs in mental health hospitals, for example: EHR system incompatibility with IT systems used by mental health–related sectors, notably social services; the EHR system lacking specific, mental health functionalities and options; and clinicians feeling unable to use computers while attending to distressed psychiatric patients.



Conclusions
A better conceptual model of reasons for workarounds should help with designing, and supporting the implementation and adoption of, EHRs for use in hospital mental health settings.",10,[],0,0,0.0,0,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0077669,A Qualitative Exploration of Workarounds Related to the Implementation of National Electronic Health Records in Early Adopter Mental Health Hospitals

Aims
To investigate the role of dopamine in cognitive and motor learning skill deficits after a traumatic brain injury (TBI), we investigated dopamine release and behavioral changes at a series of time points after fluid percussion injury, and explored the potential of amantadine hydrochloride as a chronic treatment to provide behavioral recovery.



Materials and Methods
In this study, we sequentially investigated dopamine release at the striatum and behavioral changes at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after fluid percussion injury. Rats subjected to 6-Pa cerebral cortical fluid percussion injury were treated by using subcutaneous infusion pumps filled with either saline (sham group) or amantadine hydrochloride, with a releasing rate of 3.6mg/kg/hour for 8 weeks. The dopamine-releasing conditions and metabolism were analyzed sequentially by fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Novel object recognition (NOR) and fixed-speed rotarod (FSRR) behavioral tests were used to determine treatment effects on cognitive and motor deficits after injury.



Results
Sequential dopamine-release deficits were revealed in 6-Pa-fluid-percussion cerebral cortical injured animals. The reuptake rate (tau value) of dopamine in injured animals was prolonged, but the tau value became close to the value for the control group after amantadine therapy. Cognitive and motor learning impairments were shown evidenced by the NOR and FSRR behavioral tests after injury. Chronic amantadine therapy reversed dopamine-release deficits, and behavioral impairment after fluid percussion injuries were ameliorated in the rats treated by using amantadine-pumping infusion.



Conclusion
Chronic treatment with amantadine hydrochloride can ameliorate dopamine-release deficits as well as cognitive and motor deficits caused by cerebral fluid-percussion injury.",10,"['were treated', 'were analyzed', 'were used', 'were revealed', 'was prolonged', 'were shown', 'evidenced by the nor and fsrr behavioral tests after injury', 'were ameliorated']",8,7,0.7,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0086354,Amantadine Ameliorates Dopamine-Releasing Deficits and Behavioral Deficits in Rats after Fluid Percussion Injury

Aims
To investigate the value of coronary calcium scoring (CCS) as a filter scan prior to coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).



Methods and Results
Between February 2008 and April 2011, 732 consecutive patients underwent clinically indicated CCTA. During this ‘control phase’, CCS was performed in all patients. In patients with CCS≥800, CCTA was not performed. During a subsequent ‘CCTA phase’ (May 2011–May 2012) another 200 consecutive patients underwent CCTA, and CCS was performed only in patients with increased probability for severe calcification according to age, gender and atherogenic risk factors. In patients where CCS was not performed, calcium scoring was performed in contrast-enhanced CCTA images. Significant associations were noted between CCS and age (r = 0.30, p<0.001) and coronary risk factors (χ2 = 37.9; HR = 2.2; 95%CI = 1.7–2.9, p<0.001). Based on these associations, a ≤3% pre-test probability for CCS≥800 was observed for males <61 yrs. and females <79 yrs. According to these criteria, CCS was not performed in 106 of 200 (53%) patients during the ‘CCTA phase’, including 47 (42%) males and 59 (67%) females. This resulted in absolute radiation saving of ∼1 mSv in 75% of patients younger than 60 yrs. Of 106 patients where CCS was not performed, estimated calcium scoring was indeed <800 in 101 (95%) cases. Non-diagnostic image quality due to calcification was similar between the ‘control phase’ and the ‘CCTA’ group (0.25% versus 0.40%, p = NS).



Conclusion
The value of CCS as a filter for identification of a high calcium score is limited in younger patients with intermediate risk profile. Omitting CCS in such patients can contribute to further dose reduction with cardiac CT studies.",14,"['was performed', 'was not performed', 'was performed', 'was not performed', 'was performed', 'were noted', 'was observed', 'was not performed', 'was not performed', 'is limited']",10,9,0.6428571428571429,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0092396,"When Do We Really Need Coronary Calcium Scoring Prior to Contrast-Enhanced Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography?

Aims
To investigate whether education level of family members predicts all-cause and cardiovascular death and initial-episode peritonitis in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD).



Methods
A total of 2264 patients on chronic PD were collected from seven centers affiliated with the Socioeconomic Status on the Outcome of Peritoneal Dialysis (SSOP) Study. All demographic, socioeconomic and laboratory data of patients and the education level of all family members were recorded at baseline. Multivariate Cox regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and initial-episode peritonitis with adjustments for recognized traditional factors.



Results
There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between patients with (n = 1752) and without (n = 512) complete education information. According to the highest education level of patients' family, included 1752 patients were divided into four groups, i.e. elementary or lower (15%), middle (27%), high (24%) and more than high school (34%). The family highest education (using elementary school or lower group as reference, hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval of middle school group, high school group and more than high school group was 0.68[0.48–0.96], 0.64[0.45–0.91], 0.66[0.48–0.91], respectively) rather than their average education level or patients' or spouse's education was significantly associated with the higher mortality. Neither patients' nor family education level did correlate to the risk for cardiovascular death or initial-episode peritonitis.



Conclusions
Family members' education level was found to be a novel predictor of PD outcome. Family, as the main source of health care providers, should be paid more attention in our practice.",10,"['were collected', 'were recorded', 'was used', 'were divided', 'was found', 'should be paid']",6,6,0.6,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095894,The Associations between the Family Education and Mortality of Patients on Peritoneal Dialysis

Aims
To investigate whether multi-frequency measurement of vibration perception thresholds (VPTs) can identify individuals with a high risk of developing diabetic foot ulcer or neuropathic symptoms.



Methods
VPTs were measured at six different frequencies (4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 125 Hz) on metatarsal heads 1 and 5 on the sole of the foot using a standard VibroSense Meter device in 535 type 1 diabetic (T1DM) patients and 717 non-diabetic control subjects. VPTs in control subjects were used to establish normal values for five different age groups for male and female subjects respectively. Normal values were defined as a VPT below the mean plus 1.66 x standard deviation for each group. Various definitions of abnormal VPTs were tested using either all frequencies, only lowest VPT frequencies (4 and 8 Hz) or only highest VPT frequencies (64 and 125 Hz).



Results
The VPTs were higher in T1DM patients than in non-diabetic control subjects matched for age and gender. The low frequencies, 4 and 8 Hz, particularly were associated with the risk of diabetic foot ulcer (OR 40.7 [5.4–308.4], p = 0.0003) and with difficulties in balance and or gait (OR 1.89 [1.04–3.46], p = 0.04) difficulties and weakness (OR 2.77 [1.25–6.16], p = 0.01). The VPTs at the 125 Hz frequency were higher in short duration (≤ 10 yrs.) T1DM patients compared to age- and gender-matched control subjects.



Conclusions
Vibration perception thresholds at low frequencies seem to be a better indicator of the risk of developing diabetic foot ulcers, gait or balance problems or weakness of the foot. The 125 Hz frequency, however, seemed to be impaired earlier and it was the only pathological VPT frequency in patients with short duration of diabetes.This study suggests that at least four different frequencies (4, 8, 64 and 125 Hz) should be included in any examination in order to obtain a complete evaluation of the risk factors for diabetic neuropathy and diabetic foot ulcers.",11,"['were measured', 'were used', 'were defined', 'were tested', 'be impaired', 'should be included']",6,5,0.45454545454545453,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0212921,"Strong association between vibration perception thresholds at low frequencies (4 and 8 Hz), neuropathic symptoms and diabetic foot ulcers"

Aims
To investigate while accounting for health at birth 1) associations between health problems during childhood, measured as hospitalizations, and school achievement in the final year of compulsory school, measured as overall grade points and eligibility for upper secondary education, 2) if and how gender moderates the association between health problems and school achievement, 3) if and how the timing of a health problem during childhood is associated with later school achievement.



Methods
Analyzes were performed on a population-based cohort (n = 115 196) born in 1990 in Sweden (51.3% boys, 48.7% girls) using data from several national registries. Multiple linear regression and logistic regression were used to analyze associations between study variables.



Results
Overall grade points and eligibility for continuation to upper secondary school were lower for individuals exposed to hospitalizations. Only the association between hospitalizations and overall grade points was moderated by gender and only for ages 13–16 years. Exposure close to actual grading had worst outcomes.



Conclusions
Health problems, measured through hospitalizations, was significantly associated with lower school achievements among Swedish children. Girls exposed to health problems requiring hospitalizations had relatively poorer school achievements as compared to boys. Health problems requiring hospitalization during junior high school had the greatest negative association with final achievement at compulsory school.",9,"['were performed', 'were used', 'was moderated']",3,3,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208116,"Health problems during childhood and school achievement: Exploring associations between hospitalization exposures, gender, timing, and compulsory school grades"

Aims
To investigate young people’s attitudes to, and understanding of, physical activity on glycaemic control in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.



Methods
Four focus groups with 11–14 and 15–16 year olds were conducted with twelve young people with Type 1 Diabetes, from within a larger study investigating physical activity and fitness. Qualitative analysis of the focus group data was performed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.



Results
Four superordinate themes were identified: Benefits of Exercise, Knowledge and Understanding, Information and Training and “You can do anything”. Young people felt that exercising helped them to manage their diabetes and had a beneficial psychological and physical impact on their bodies. They reported a lack of knowledge and understanding about diabetes among school staff and other young people. The overwhelming sense from young people was that although diabetes impacts upon their lives, with preparation, physical activity can take place as normal.



Conclusions
Whilst young people had an awareness of the physical and psychological benefits of exercise in managing their diabetes, they experienced difficulties at school. Professional support and discussions with young people, giving tailored strategies for managing Type 1 Diabetes during exercise are needed. Healthcare teams should ensure that the support and educational needs of school staff are met. Providing more opportunities to empower young people to take on the responsibility for their Type 1 Diabetes care is merited. Young people felt diabetes did not stop them from participating in activities; it is simply a part of them that needs managing throughout life.",11,"['were conducted', 'was performed', 'were identified', 'are needed', 'are met', 'is merited']",6,5,0.45454545454545453,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137562,Attitudes to Exercise and Diabetes in Young People with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: A Qualitative Analysis
"Abstract

Aims
To know the prevalence, associated factors and temporal trends of disabilities for basic and instrumental activities of daily living in older people in Spain from 2009 to 2017.



Background
Disability in older people is associated with health problems, increased health costs and low quality of life. There are no updated data in Spain with a representative sample about disability.



Methods
Cross-sectional study with 25,465 non-institutionalized older people who participated in the European Health Survey in 2009 and 2014 and the National Health Survey in 2011/12 and 2017 in Spain. The prevalence rates of disability were evaluated using the Katz Scale and Lawton and Brody Scale. Logistic regression was used to determine if there was an association between basic and instrumental activities of daily living and sociodemographic characteristics.



Results
More individuals had disability for instrumental activities of daily living (31.9%) than disability for basic activities of daily living (11.1%). The most predominant disability for instrumental activities of daily living was performing severe housework (34%). The prevalence of disabilities decreased from 2009 to 2017. In general, disability was associated with female gender, advanced age, lower education, restricted daily activity, being bedridden and higher pain levels.



Conclusion
There is a considerable prevalence of disabilities for basic and instrumental activities of daily living in older people in Spain. Although the disability prevalence has decreased slowly from 2009 to 2017, it continues to remain a health problem. Gender may influence the disabilities for basic and instrumental activities of daily living. Health policymakers should establish prevention strategies and effective interventions (e.g., physical exercise) for prevention and reduction of the disabilities for basic and instrumental activities of daily living, particularly in older females.",14,"['were evaluated', 'was used']",2,2,0.14285714285714285,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0220157,Disability for basic and instrumental activities of daily living in older individuals

Aims
To measure the degree and direction of errors in recall of age at first sex.



Method
Participants were initially recruited in 1994–1995 (Wave I) with 3 subsequent follow-ups in: 1996 (Wave II); 2001– 2002 (Wave III); and 2007–2008 (Wave IV). Participants' individual errors in recall of their age at first sex at Wave IV were estimated by the paired difference between responses given for age at first sex in Wave I and Wave IV (recalled age at first sex obtained at Wave IV minus the age at first sex obtained at Wave I).



Results
The mean of the recall-estimation of age at first sex at Wave IV was found to be slightly increased comparing to the age at first sex at Wave I (less than 1 year). The errors in the recalled age at first sex tended to increase in participants who had their first sex younger or older than the average, and the recalled age at first sex tended to bias towards the mean (i.e. participants who had first sex younger than the average were more likely to recall an age at first sex that was older than the age, and vice versa).



Conclusions
In this U.S. population-based sample, the average recall error for age at first sex was small. However, the accuracy of recalled information varied significantly among subgroup populations.",8,"['were initially recruited', 'were estimated', 'was found', 'be slightly increased']",4,3,0.375,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0072947,Errors in Recall of Age at First Sex

Aims
To present the longitudinal data of the SUBITO-DE study, a prospective survey involving male patients with new or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (<24 months).



Materials and Methods
Sexual function was assessed in male patients with T2DM at baseline (phase 1) and after a mean follow-up of 18 months (phase 2). Standard metabolic parameters and sexual and depressive symptoms were evaluated.



Results
Six of the 499 enrolled patients died of different causes during phase 1. Of the 493 surviving men invited to participate in phase 2, 450 (mean age 59.0±9.0 years) (90.2%) accepted and 43 (8.2%) were lost to follow-up. As compared to baseline, the proportion of the men who reported improvement in erectile dysfunction (ED) at follow-up was nearly double that of the men who reported worsening of ED (22.6% vs. 12.8%). The increase in frequency of sexual activity the men reported at follow-up assessment indicates that many never treated before baseline were taking an ED drug during the study period (106 subjects). Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) were the ED drugs most commonly taken at both baseline and follow-up. An overall improvement over baseline values was observed in metabolic targets for T2DM and depressive symptoms. Conversely, no change in lifestyle behaviors was recorded during the study.



Conclusions
Sexual dysfunction is a major concern in men with T2DM. The SUBITO-DE study demonstrates that, when combined with adequate counseling and tailored PDE5i therapy, an integrated approach to achieving metabolic targets in men with T2DM can improve sexual function as well as depressive symptoms.",11,"['was assessed', 'were evaluated', 'were lost', 'was observed', 'was recorded']",5,5,0.45454545454545453,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157915,Sexual Dysfunction in Type 2 Diabetes at Diagnosis: Progression over Time and Drug and Non-Drug Correlated Factors
"Abstract

Aims
To report corneal topometric and aberrometric values in mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) and to investigate their correlation with biomechanical corneal parameters.



Methods
One randomly chosen eye of 20 MPS patients with no to moderate corneal clouding and one eye of 23 healthy controls with comparable age were prospectively included into this study. Corneal surface regularity was assessed by index of surface variance (ISV), -vertical asymmetry (IVA), -height asymmetry (IHA), -height decentration (IHD); keratoconus index (KI), central keratoconus index (CKI) and Zernike indices of anterior and posterior corneal surface using Scheimpflug imaging (Pentacam). Corneal resistance factor (CRF) and corneal hysteresis (CH) were assessed by Ocular Response Analyzer. Statistical analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney-Test and Spearman Correlation Coefficients.



Results
IVA, ISV, IHD, IHA, but not KI and CKI were significantly higher in MPS patients compared to age matched healthy controls. Spherical aberration and asphericity coefficients either at the anterior or at the posterior corneal surface differed significantly between both groups. The grade of the MPS-associated corneal opacity correlated significantly with ISV (rho = 0.52), IVA (rho = 0.54), IHA (rho = 0.57) and IHD (rho = 0.48). Density of the MPS-affected corneas correlated significantly with ISV (rho = 0.52), IVA (rho = 0.72), IHA (rho = 0.57), IHD (rho = 0.69), 3rd order horizontal trefoil aberration at the posterior (rho = 0.62) and anterior surface (rho = 0.48) as well as with CH (rho = 0.55) and CRF (rho = 0.57). Spherical aberration at the back surface correlated with CRF and CH in MPS and in healthy controls.



Conclusions
This is the first study analyzing shape of the corneal surface in MPS patients. Topometric indices of corneal asymmetry are significantly increased and correlate with MPS-related corneal opacity and density. Spherical aberration and asphericity coefficient at the front and at the back corneal surface differ significantly between MPS and healthy controls.",14,"['were prospectively included', 'was assessed', 'were assessed', 'were performed', 'are significantly increased and correlate with']",5,5,0.35714285714285715,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0218108,"Corneal topometric, aberrometric and biomechanical parameters in mucopolysaccharidosis patients"

Aims
To summarize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of physical counterpressure manoeuvers (PCM) for vasovagal syncope management compared to a control intervention. Control interventions included either a PCM, no intervention, or other interventions feasible in a lay setting.



Methods
A systematic literature search (March 21st 2018) was performed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase. PCM were subdivided into 1) PCM decreasing orthostatic load (PCMOL), 2) PCM shortening the hydrostatic column between heart and brain (PCMHC), 3) PCM using mechanical compression of the veins (PCMMC). The primary outcome was syncope, secondary outcomes included systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and total peripheral resistance (TPR). When possible, a random effects meta-analysis was performed. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated for continuous outcomes. Heterogeneity was assessed by means of the I2 statistic. The total body of evidence was evaluated by means of the GRADE methodology.



Results
Eleven trials involving 688 people with vasovagal syncope were included. Risk of bias was high in all included studies. The total body of evidence (GRADE) was considered to be low or very low. PCM were found to improve syncope as compared to control (OR: 0.52, 95% CI [0.33;0.81], p = 0.004). Similarly, before-and-after studies without a control group showed a significant reduction in syncope following PCM (OR: 0.01, 95%CI [0.00;0.01], p<0.001). No studies investigated PCMOL. PCMHC increased SBP, DBP, MAP, SV, and CO, and decreased HR. PCMMC increased SBP, DBP, and MAP.



Conclusion
PCM may reduce syncope and increase SBP, DBP, and MAP. The effects on other outcomes are less clear. Additional high-quality studies are needed.",20,"['was performed', 'were subdivided', 'was performed', 'were calculated', 'were calculated', 'was assessed', 'was evaluated', 'were included', 'was considered', 'were found', 'are needed']",11,10,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0212012,Physical manoeuvers as a preventive intervention to manage vasovagal syncope: A systematic review

Aims
To systematically review the evidence of socioeconomic inequalities for adults with type 1 diabetes in relation to mortality, morbidity and diabetes management.



Methods
We carried out a systematic search across six relevant databases and included all studies reporting associations between socioeconomic indicators and mortality, morbidity, or diabetes management for adults with type 1 diabetes. Data extraction and quality assessment was undertaken for all included studies. A narrative synthesis was conducted.



Results
A total of 33 studies were identified. Twelve cohort, 19 cross sectional and 2 case control studies met the inclusion criteria. Regardless of healthcare system, low socioeconomic status was associated with poorer outcomes. Following adjustments for other risk factors, socioeconomic status was a statistically significant independent predictor of mortality in 9/10 studies and morbidity in 8/10 studies for adults with type 1 diabetes. There appeared to be an association between low socioeconomic status and some aspects of diabetes management. Although only 3 of 16 studies made adjustments for confounders and other risk factors, poor diabetes management was associated with lower socioeconomic status in 3/3 of these studies.



Conclusions
Low socioeconomic status is associated with higher levels of mortality and morbidity for adults with type 1 diabetes even amongst those with access to a universal healthcare system. The association between low socioeconomic status and diabetes management requires further research given the paucity of evidence and the potential for diabetes management to mitigate the adverse effects of low socioeconomic status.",12,"['was undertaken', 'was conducted', 'were identified']",3,3,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177210,"Socioeconomic inequalities in mortality, morbidity and diabetes management for adults with type 1 diabetes: A systematic review"

Aims
To translate the English version of Tegner Activity Score into a Simplified-Chinese version (Tegner-C) and evaluate its psychometric properties.



Methods
Tegner-C was cross-culturally adapted according to established guidelines. The validity and reliability of Tegner-C were assessed in 78 participants, with 19–20 participants in each of the four groups: before anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (pre-ACLR) group, 2–3 months after ACLR group, 3–12 months after ACLR group, and healthy control group. Each participant was asked to complete the Tegner-C and Chinese version of International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF-C) twice, with an interval of 5±2 days. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC2, 1) was used to assess the reliability and Spearman’s rank correlation was used for construct validity.



Results
The ICC2,1 was higher than 0.90 for all groups except in the pre-ACLR group, for which the ICC2,1 was 0.71 (0.41, 0.87) (All with p<0.001). The absolute reliability as evaluated by the smallest detectable change was 0.43, 2.12, 0.89, and 0.44 for the healthy control group, pre-ACLR group, 2–3 months after ACLR group, and 3–12 months after ACLR group, respectively. Neither a ceiling effect nor a floor effect was observed for any group. Significant difference was observed for both Tegner-C and IKDC-SKF-C scores between the control and the other three groups (all with p<0.001), and between pre-ACLR and the 2–3 months after ACLR group (p<0.001).

Aims
Two behavioral HIV prevention interventions for people who inject drugs (PWID) infected with HIV include the Holistic Health Recovery Program for HIV+ (HHRP+), a comprehensive evidence-based CDC-supported program, and an abbreviated Holistic Health for HIV (3H+) Program, an adapted HHRP+ version in treatment settings. We compared the projected health benefits and cost-effectiveness of both programs, in addition to opioid substitution therapy (OST), to the status quo in the U.S.



Methods
A dynamic HIV transmission model calibrated to epidemic data of current US populations was created. Projected outcomes include future HIV incidence, HIV prevalence, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained under alternative strategies. Total medical costs were estimated to compare the cost-effectiveness of each strategy.



Results
Over 10 years, expanding HHRP+ access to 80% of PWID could avert up to 29,000 HIV infections, or 6% of the projected total, at a cost of $7,777/QALY gained. Alternatively, 3H+ could avert 19,000 infections, but is slightly more cost-effective ($7,707/QALY), and remains so under widely varying effectiveness and cost assumptions. Nearly two-thirds of infections averted with either program are among non-PWIDs, due to reduced sexual transmission from PWID to their partners. Expanding these programs with broader OST coverage could avert up to 74,000 HIV infections over 10 years and reduce HIV prevalence from 16.5% to 14.1%, but is substantially more expensive than HHRP+ or 3H+ alone.



Conclusions
Both behavioral interventions were effective and cost-effective at reducing HIV incidence among both PWID and the general adult population; however, 3H+, the economical HHRP+ version, was slightly more cost-effective than HHRP+.",9,"['model calibrated', 'was created', 'were estimated']",3,2,0.2222222222222222,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0116694,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Brief and Expanded Evidence-Based Risk Reduction Interventions for HIV-Infected People Who Inject Drugs in the United States

Aims
Vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) are considered to be related to gastric functions and the regulation of stress response. The present study was to study the role of vasopressinergic and oxytocinergic neurons during the restraint water-immersion stress.



Methods
Ten male Wistar rats were divided into two groups, control and RWIS for 1h. The brain sections were treated with a dual immunohistochemistry of Fos and oxytocin (OT) or vasopressin (AVP) or OT receptor or AVP 1b receptor (V1bR).



Results
(1) Fos-immunoreactive (Fos-IR) neurons dramatically increased in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the supraoptic nucleus (SON), the neucleus of solitary tract (NTS) and motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) in the RWIS rats; (2) OT-immunoreactive (OT-IR) neurons were mainly observed in the medial magnocellular part of the PVN and the dorsal portion of the SON, while AVP-immunoreactive (AVP-IR) neurons mainly distributed in the magnocellular part of the PVN and the ventral portion of the SON. In the RWIS rats, Fos-IR neurons were indentified in 31% of OT-IR neurons and 40% of AVP-IR neurons in the PVN, while in the SON it represented 28%, 53% respectively; (3) V1bR-IR and OTR-IR neurons occupied all portions of the NTS and DMV. In the RWIS rats, more than 10% of OTR-IR and V1bR-IR neurons were activated in the DMV, while lower ratio in the NTS.



Conclusion
RWIS activates both oxytocinergic and vasopressinergic neurons in the PVN and SON, which may project to the NTS or DMV mediating the activity of the neurons by OTR and V1bR.",8,"['are considered', 'be related', 'were divided', 'were treated', 'were mainly observed', 'were indentified', 'were activated']",7,6,0.75,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0023362,Oxytocin and Vasopressin Involved in Restraint Water-Immersion Stress Mediated by Oxytocin Receptor and Vasopressin 1b Receptor in Rat Brain
"Abstract

Aims
We aimed to provide reference values for speckle-tracking derived systolic and diastolic myocardial deformation markers, and to determine their relation with age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors.



Methods and results
The Characteristics and Course of Heart Failure STAges A/B and Determinants of Progression (STAAB) cohort study recruited a representative sample of the population of Würzburg, Germany, aged 30–79 years. In a sample of 1818 participants (52% female, mean age 54±12 years) global longitudinal peak systolic strain (GL-PSS, n = 1218), systolic (GL-SSR, n = 1506), and early (GL-EDSR, n = 1506) and late diastolic strain rates (GL-LDSR, n = 1500) were derived from 2D speckle tracking analysis. From a subgroup of 323 individuals without any cardiovascular risk factor, sex- and age-specific reference values were computed. GL-PSS, GL-SSR, and GL-EDSR were associated with sex, GL-EDSR decreased and GL-LDSR increased with age. In the total sample, dyslipidemia was associated with altered GL-PSS, GL-SSR, and GL-EDSR in women but not in men, whereas obesity was associated with less favorable GL-PSS and GL-EDSR in either sex. Hypertension impacted more adversely on systolic and diastolic myocardial deformation in women compared to men (all p<0.01).



Conclusion
The female myocardium appeared more vulnerable to high blood pressure and dyslipidemia when compared to men, while obesity was associated with adverse myocardial deformation in either sex.

Aims and objectives
To assess the depression status of type 2 diabetic retinopathy patients in Nantong China and to identify factors associated with depression.



Methods
Two hundred and ninety-four patients with type 2 diabetic retinopathy were recruited from the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University. The severity of DR was measured in the worse eye. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D); the quality of life was measured with the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36). The logistic regression analyses were used to identify the independent factors of depression.



Results
The mean age of the study subjects was 57.77 years (SD: 9.64). Approximately 35.7% of subjects reported depressive symptoms (n = 105).Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that female gender (p = 0.014), low monthly income (p = 0.01), poor vision in the better eye (P = 0.002), laser treatment history (p = 0.01) were significant risk factors for depression. The quality of life of individuals with CES-D score<16 was significantly better compared with individuals with CES-D score≥16.



Conclusion
The reported depressive symptoms among type 2 diabetic retinopathy population is higher in Nantong China. Gender, salary, vision acuity and treatment history were important risk factors linked to this disorder in the Chinese type 2 diabetic retinopathy population from Nantong. More attention by medical care personnel needs to be paid to the psychological health of this population.",11,"['were recruited', 'was measured', 'were assessed', 'was measured', 'were used', 'factors linked', 'be paid']",7,6,0.5454545454545454,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132616,Investigating Factors Associated with Depression of Type 2 Diabetic Retinopathy Patients in China

Aims and objectives
To classify hemodialysis patients into subgroups via cluster analysis according to the Somatic Symptoms Disturbance Index, Taiwanese Depression Scale, and Herth Hope Index scores. Patient demands in each cluster were also examined.



Background
Overall patient demands among hemodialysis patients have been demonstrated in numerous reports; however, variables among subgroups have not been explored.



Methods
Data were analyzed from a cross-sectional survey of 114 hemodialysis patients recruited from dialysis centers in Northern Taiwan. Hope, depression, and symptom disturbance were used as parameters for clustering because they have been shown to be important factors affecting patient demands. A two-step cluster analysis was performed to classify participants into clusters. Patient demands in each cluster were analyzed.



Results
Among the 114 participants, there was a negative correlation between hope and depression as well as between hope and symptom disturbance; there was a positive correlation between depression and symptom disturbance. Two clusters were identified: Cluster 1 (n = 49) included patients with moderate levels of hope and symptom disturbance, and high levels of depression; and Cluster 2 (n = 65) included patients with low levels of depression and symptom disturbance and high levels of hope. Demographic profiles differed between the two clusters. Regarding patient demands, medical demand showed the highest average score; whereas, occupational demand exhibited the lowest average score. Psychological and occupational demands differed significantly between the two clusters. The two clusters were defined as subgroups: Cluster 1 was labeled “resting”; Cluster 2 was labeled “active”.



Conclusions
Cluster analysis may further classify hemodialysis patients into distinct subgroups base on their specific patient demands. A better understanding of patient demands may help health professionals to provide a holistic individualized treatment to improve patients’ outcomes.",15,"['were also examined', 'have been demonstrated', 'been explored', 'were analyzed', 'were used', 'have been shown', 'was performed', 'were analyzed', 'were identified', 'were defined', 'was labeled', 'was labeled']",12,8,0.5333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0228259,Exploring demands of hemodialysis patients in Taiwan: A two-step cluster analysis

Aims and objectives
To explore the home care experiences of caregivers taking care of CHD children before and after cardiac surgery.



Background
Despite the prevalence of congenital heart disease (CHD) in childhood, little is known about the experiences and impacts on the children and their caregivers after CHD diagnosis and surgery. Such knowledge is needed for meaningful support.



Design
A qualitative descriptive study.



Methods
Twenty-two caregivers of CHD children undergoing cardiac surgery participated in semi-structured interviews at a University Children’s Hospital in China. Data were collected by an experienced and trained interviewer. Qualitative content analysis was chosen to describe the experiences of the caregivers.



Results
Caregivers of CHD children experienced significant demands. After the children underwent their CHD operations, the caregivers experienced complex psychological feelings and excessive stress impacting upon theirlives. In addition, caregivers constantly adapted their roles with self-fulfillment in caring activities.



Conclusions
CHD surgery has a major impact on the emotions and daily lives of children and their caregivers. This study offers a framework for understanding the importance of actively listening to caregivers so coping strategies can be implemented.



Relevance to clinical practice
Theexperiencesdescribed in this study contribute to a better understanding of the needs of caregivers whose children underwent CHD operations. They also provide valuable information to professional medical care staff that developfuture nursing assessments.",14,"['is known', 'is needed', 'were collected', 'was chosen', 'can be implemented']",5,5,0.35714285714285715,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0213154,Home care experience and nursing needs of caregivers of children undergoing congenital heart disease operations: A qualitative descriptive study

Aims/Hypothesis
Obesity is associated with a dysregulation of beta-cell and adipocyte function. The molecular interactions between adipose tissue and beta-cells are not yet fully elucidated. We investigated, whether or not the adipocytokine Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) and its enzymatic product Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which has been associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) directly influence beta-cell survival and function.



Methods
The effect of Nampt and NMN on viability of INS-1E cells was assessed by WST-1 assay. Apoptosis was measured by Annexin V/PI and TUNEL assay. Activation of apoptosis signaling pathways was evaluated. Adenylate kinase release was determined to assess cytotoxicity. Chronic and acute effects of the adipocytokine Nampt and its enzymatic product NMN on insulin secretion were assessed by glucose stimulated insulin secretion in human islets.



Results
While stimulation of beta-cells with the cytokines IL-1β, TNFα and IFN-γ or palmitate significantly decreased viability, Nampt and NMN showed no direct effect on viability in INS-1E cells or in human islets, neither alone nor in the presence of pro-diabetic conditions (elevated glucose concentrations and palmitate or cytokines). At chronic conditions over 3 days of culture, Nampt and its product NMN had no effects on insulin secretion. In contrast, both Nampt and NMN potentiated glucose stimulated insulin secretion acutely during 1 h incubation of human islets.



Conclusion/Interpretation
Nampt and NMN neither influenced beta-cell viability nor apoptosis but acutely potentiated glucose stimulated insulin secretion.",12,"['was assessed', 'was measured', 'was evaluated', 'were assessed']",4,4,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0054106,The Adipocytokine Nampt and Its Product NMN Have No Effect on Beta-Cell Survival but Potentiate Glucose Stimulated Insulin Secretion
"Abstract

Aims/Hypothesis
One of the hallmarks of diabetes is impaired endothelial function. Previous studies showed that HDL can exert protective effects on endothelium stimulating NO production and protecting from inflammation and suggested that HDL in obese people with diabetes and dyslipidemia may have lower endothelial protective function. We aimed to investigate whether type 2 diabetes impairs HDL endothelium protective functions in people with otherwise normal lipid profile.



Methods
In a case-control study (n = 41 per group) nested in the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study we tested the ability of HDL to protect endothelium by stimulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity and suppressing NFκB-mediated inflammatory response in endothelial cells. In parallel we measured HDL protein composition, sphinogosine-1-phosphate and P-selectin.



Results
Despite similar levels of plasma HDL-C the HDL in individuals with type 2 diabetes lost almost 40% of its ability to stimulate eNOS activity (P<0.001) and 20% of its ability to suppress TNFα-dependent NFκB-mediated inflammatory response in endothelial cells (P<0.001) compared to non-T2D controls despite similar BMI and lipid profile (HDL-C, LDL-C, TC, TG). Significantly, the ability of HDL to stimulate eNOS activity was negatively associated with plasma levels of P-selectin, an established marker of endothelial dysfunction (r = −0.32, P<0.001). Furthermore, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels were decreased in diabetic plasma (P = 0.017) and correlated with HDL-mediated eNOS activation.



Conclusions/Interpretations
Collectively, our data suggest that HDL in individuals with type 2 diabetes loses its ability to maintain proper endothelial function independent of HDL-C, perhaps due to loss of S1P, and may contribute to development of diabetic complications.",9,['were decreased'],1,1,0.1111111111111111,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192616,Type 2 diabetes is associated with loss of HDL endothelium protective functions

Back ground
Diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate throughout the world and about 80% of diabetic cases live in low and middle income countries. Glycemic control is the most important predictor for diabetic related complications and deaths. Identifying factors associated with glycemic control help health care providers and patients to work in the areas that reduce risks of diabetic related complications and deaths.



Objectives
The aim of this study is to assess the magnitude and factors associated with glycemic control among type 2 diabetic patients at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.



Methods
Hospital-based cross sectional study was conducted on 412 type 2 diabetic patients who were attending in diabetic clinics at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital. Data were collected through structured interview questionnaire, and data abstraction format to collect information from each patient’s medical records from March to April, 2015. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20 statistical software. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used to determine magnitude of glycemic control and factors associated with poor glycemic control.



Result
Median age of participants was 52 years old (IQR = 40–60 years old). From the study participants,51.7% were females. Median duration of living with diabetes since diagnosis was 10 years (IQR: 5–16 years). About 80% of the respondents had uncontrolled fasting blood glucose level. The factors which are significantly associated with poor glycemic control were longer duration of diabetes (AOR = 2.72 95%CI:1.16–6.32), and being on insulin therapy (AOR = 3.01 95% CI: 1.5–5.9).



Conclusion
A high proportion of patients had poor glycemic control. Longer duration of the disease, and being on drug regimen of insulin were associated with poor glycemic control. Appropriate attention should be given to patients with longer duration of disease and those who are on insulin therapy.",17,"['was conducted', 'were collected', 'were entered and analyzed using', 'were used', 'should be given']",5,5,0.29411764705882354,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193442,"Magnitude of glycemic control and its associated factors among patients with type 2 diabetes at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"
"Abstract

Backgound
The purpose of this study was to assess the biological and clinical effects of n-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) in Parkinson’s disease (PD).



Methods
The overarching goal of this pilot study was to generate additional data about potentially protective properties of NAC in PD, using an in vitro and in vivo approach. In preparation for the clinical study we performed a cell tissue culture study with human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons that were treated with rotenone as a model for PD. The primary outcome in the cell tissue cultures was the number of cells that survived the insult with the neurotoxin rotenone. In the clinical study, patients continued their standard of care and were randomized to receive either daily NAC or were a waitlist control. Patients were evaluated before and after 3 months of receiving the NAC with DaTscan to measure dopamine transporter (DAT) binding and the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) to measure clinical symptoms.



Results
The cell line study showed that NAC exposure resulted in significantly more mDA neurons surviving after exposure to rotenone compared to no NAC, consistent with the protective effects of NAC previously observed. The clinical study showed significantly increased DAT binding in the caudate and putamen (mean increase ranging from 4.4% to 7.8%; p<0.05 for all values) in the PD group treated with NAC, and no measurable changes in the control group. UPDRS scores were also significantly improved in the NAC group (mean improvement of 12.9%, p = 0.01).



Conclusions
The results of this preliminary study demonstrate for the first time a potential direct effect of NAC on the dopamine system in PD patients, and this observation may be associated with positive clinical effects. A large-scale clinical trial to test the therapeutic efficacy of NAC in this population and to better elucidate the mechanism of action is warranted.

"Abstract

Background
 Alterations in gene expression in the suicide brain have been reported and for several genes DNA methylation as an epigenetic regulator is thought to play a role. rRNA genes, that encode ribosomal RNA, are the backbone of the protein synthesis machinery and levels of rRNA gene promoter methylation determine rRNA transcription.



Methodology/Principal Findings
We test here by sodium bisulfite mapping of the rRNA promoter and quantitative real-time PCR of rRNA expression the hypothesis that epigenetic differences in critical loci in the brain are involved in the pathophysiology of suicide. Suicide subjects in this study were selected for a history of early childhood neglect/abuse, which is associated with decreased hippocampal volume and cognitive impairments. rRNA was significantly hypermethylated throughout the promoter and 5′ regulatory region in the brain of suicide subjects, consistent with reduced rRNA expression in the hippocampus. This difference in rRNA methylation was not evident in the cerebellum and occurred in the absence of genome-wide changes in methylation, as assessed by nearest neighbor.



Conclusions/Significance
This is the first study to show aberrant regulation of the protein synthesis machinery in the suicide brain. The data implicate the epigenetic modulation of rRNA in the pathophysiology of suicide.",9,"['have been reported', 'is thought', 'were selected', 'was significantly hypermethylated', 'assessed by nearest neighbor']",5,4,0.4444444444444444,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002085,Promoter-Wide Hypermethylation of the Ribosomal RNA Gene Promoter in the Suicide Brain

Background
 Patient retention in chronic HIV care is a major challenge following the rapid expansion of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in Ethiopia.



Objective
 To describe the proportion of patients who are retained in HIV care and characterize predictors of attrition among HIV-infected adults receiving cART in Addis Ababa.



Method
 A retrospective analysis was conducted among 836 treatment naïve patients, who started cART between May 2009 and April 2012. Patients were randomly selected from ten health-care facilities, and their current status in HIV care was determined based on routinely available data in the medical records. Patients lost to follow-up (LTFU) were traced by telephone. Kaplan-Meier technique was used to estimate survival probabilities of retention and Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to identify the predictors of attrition.



Results
 Based on individual patient data from the medical records, nearly 80% (95%CI: 76.7, 82.1) of the patients were retained in care in the first 3 and half years of antiretroviral therapy. After successfully tracing more than half of the LTFU patients, the updated one year retention in care estimate became 86% (95% CI: 83.41%, 88.17%). In the multivariate Cox regression analyses, severe immune deficiency at enrolment in care/or at cART initiation and ‘bed-ridden’ or ‘ambulatory’ functional status at the start of cART predicted attrition.



Conclusion
Retention in HIV care in Addis Ababa is comparable with or even better than previous findings from other resource-limited as well as EU/USA settings. However, measures to detect and enroll patients in HIV care as early as possible are still necessary.",11,"['are retained', 'was conducted', 'were randomly selected', 'was determined', 'were traced', 'was used', 'was performed', 'were retained']",8,6,0.5454545454545454,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130649,Retention in HIV Care and Predictors of Attrition from Care among HIV-Infected Adults Receiving Combination Anti-Retroviral Therapy in Addis Ababa
"Abstract

Background
 Stochastic fluctuations in the protein turnover underlie the random emergence of neural precursor cells from initially homogenous cell population. If stochastic alteration of the levels in signal transduction networks is sufficient to spontaneously alter a phenotype, can it cause a sporadic chronic disease as well – including cancer?



Methods
Expression in >80 disease-free tissue environments was measured using Affymetrix microarray platform comprising 54675 probe-sets. Steps were taken to suppress the technical noise inherent to microarray experiment. Next, the integrated expression and expression variability data were aligned with the mechanistic data covering major human chronic diseases.



Results
Measured as class average, variability of expression of disease associated genes measured in health was higher than variability of random genes for all chronic pathologies. Anti-cancer FDA approved targets were displaying much higher variability as a class compared to random genes. Same held for magnitude of gene expression. The genes known to participate in multiple chronic disorders demonstrated the highest variability. Disease-related gene categories displayed on average more intricate regulation of biological function vs random reference, were enriched in adaptive and transient functions as well as positive feedback relationships.



Conclusions
A possible causative link can be suggested between normal (healthy) state gene expression variation and inception of major human pathologies, including cancer. Study of variability profiles may lead to novel diagnostic methods, therapies and better drug target prioritization. The results of the study suggest the need to advance personalized therapy development.",13,"['was measured', 'were taken', 'were aligned', 'categories displayed', 'were enriched', 'can be suggested']",6,5,0.38461538461538464,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005921,Expression Variation: Its Relevance to Emergence of Chronic Disease and to Therapy
"Abstract

Background
 The use of direct observation to monitor tuberculosis treatment is controversial: cost, practical difficulties, and lack of patient acceptability limit effectiveness. Telehealth is a promising alternative delivery method for improving implementation. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a telehealth service delivering direct observation, compared to an in-person drive-around service.



Methodology/Principal Findings
 The study was conducted within a community nursing service in South Australia. Telehealth patients received daily video calls at home on a desktop videophone provided by the nursing call center. A retrospective cohort study assessed the effectiveness of the telehealth and traditional forms of observation, defined by the proportion of missed observations recorded in case notes. This data was inputted to a model, estimating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of telehealth. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with current patients, community nursing and Chest Clinic staff, concerning service acceptability, usability and sustainability. The percentage of missed observations for the telehealth service was 12.1 (n = 58), compared to 31.1 for the in-person service (n = 70). Most of the difference of 18.9% (95% CI: 12.2 – 25.4) was due to fewer pre-arranged absences. The economic analysis calculated the ICER to be AUD$1.32 (95% CI: $0.51 – $2.26) per extra day of successful observation. The video service used less staff time, and became dominant if implemented on a larger scale and/or with decreased technology costs. Qualitative analysis found enabling factors of flexible timing, high patient acceptance, staff efficiency, and Chest Clinic support. Substantial technical problems were manageable, and improved liaison between the nursing service and Chest Clinic was an unexpected side-benefit.



Conclusions/Significance
 Home video observation is a patient-centered, resource efficient way of delivering direct observation for TB, and is cost-effective when compared with a drive-around service. Future research is recommended to determine applicability and effectiveness in other settings.",16,"['was conducted', 'was inputted', 'were conducted', 'is recommended']",4,4,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050155,Home Videophones Improve Direct Observation in Tuberculosis Treatment: A Mixed Methods Evaluation

Background
 There is considerable uncertainty about the time-course of central auditory maturation. On some indices, children appear to have adult-like competence by school age, whereas for other measures development follows a protracted course.



Methodology
 We studied auditory development using auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by tones in 105 children on two occasions two years apart. Just over half of the children were 7 years initially and 9 years at follow-up, whereas the remainder were 9 years initially and 11 years at follow-up. We used conventional analysis of peaks in the auditory ERP, independent component analysis, and time-frequency analysis.



Principal Findings
 We demonstrated maturational changes in the auditory ERP between 7 and 11 years, both using conventional peak measurements, and time-frequency analysis. The developmental trajectory was different for temporal vs. fronto-central electrode sites. Temporal electrode sites showed strong lateralisation of responses and no increase of low-frequency phase-resetting with age, whereas responses recorded from fronto-central electrode sites were not lateralised and showed progressive change with age. Fronto-central vs. temporal electrode sites also mapped onto independent components with differently oriented dipole sources in auditory cortex. A global measure of waveform shape proved to be the most effective method for distinguishing age bands.



Conclusions/Significance
The results supported the idea that different cortical regions mature at different rates. The ICC measure is proposed as the best measure of ‘auditory ERP age’.",13,"['responses recorded', 'were not lateralised', 'is proposed']",3,2,0.15384615384615385,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018993,Auditory Development between 7 and 11 Years: An Event-Related Potential (ERP) Study
"Abstract

Background
 While morbidity outcomes for major disease categories during extreme heat have received increasing research attention, there has been very limited investigation at the level of specific disease subcategories.



Methodology/Principal Findings
We analyzed daily hospital admissions for cardiovascular (CVD), respiratory (RD), genitourinary (GU) and mental diseases (MD), diabetes (DIA), dehydration (DEH) and ‘the effects of heat and light’ (HEAT) in Sydney between 1991 and 2009. We further investigated the sensitivity to heat of subcategories within the major disease groups. We defined hot days as those with temperatures in the 95th and 99th percentiles within the study period. We applied time-stratified case-crossover analysis to compare the hospital admissions on hot days with those on non-hot days matched by day of the week. We calculated the odds ratios (OR) of admissions between the two types of days, accounting for other environmental variables (relative humidity, ozone and particulate matter) and non-environmental trends (public and school holidays). On hot days, hospital admissions increased for all major categories except GU. This increase was not shared homogeneously across all diseases within a major category: within RD, only ‘other diseases of the respiratory system’ (includes pleurisy or empyema) increased significantly, while admissions for asthma decreased. Within MD, hospital admissions increased only for psychoses. Admissions due to some major categories increased one to three days after a hot day (e.g., DIA, RD and CVD) and on two and three consecutive days (e.g., HEAT and RD).



Conclusions/Significance
High ambient temperatures were associated with increased hospital admissions for several disease categories, with some within-category variation. Future analyses should focus on subgroups within broad disease categories to pinpoint medical conditions most affected by ambient heat.",11,['was not shared'],1,1,0.09090909090909091,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055459,"Cause-Specific Hospital Admissions on Hot Days in Sydney, Australia"

Background
‘Food addiction’ shares a similar neurobiological and behavioral framework with substance addiction. However whether, and to what degree, ‘food addiction’ contributes to obesity in the general population is unknown.



Objectives
to assess 1) the prevalence of ‘food addiction’ in the Newfoundland population; 2) if clinical symptom counts of ‘food addiction’ were significantly correlated with the body composition measurements; 3) if food addicts were significantly more obese than controls, and 4) if macronutrient intakes are associated with ‘food addiction’.



Design
A total of 652 adults (415 women, 237 men) recruited from the general population participated in this study. Obesity was evaluated by Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Fat percentage measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. ‘Food addiction’ was assessed using the Yale Food Addiction Scale and macronutrient intake was determined from the Willet Food Frequency Questionnaire.



Results
The prevalence of ‘food addiction’ was 5.4% (6.7% in females and 3.0% in males) and increased with obesity status. The clinical symptom counts of ‘food addiction’ were positively correlated with all body composition measurements across the entire sample (p<0.001). Obesity measurements were significantly higher in food addicts than controls; Food addicts were 11.7 (kg) heavier, 4.6 BMI units higher, and had 8.2% more body fat and 8.5% more trunk fat. Furthermore, food addicts consumed more calories from fat and protein compared with controls.



Conclusion
Our results demonstrated that ‘food addiction’ contributes to severity of obesity and body composition measurements from normal weight to obese individuals in the general population with higher rate in women as compared to men.",11,"['were significantly correlated', 'was evaluated', 'was assessed', 'was determined', 'were positively correlated']",5,4,0.36363636363636365,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0074832,Food Addiction: Its Prevalence and Significant Association with Obesity in the General Population

Background
‘Learning disabilities’ (LD) refer to a wide group of neurological disorders caused by deficits in the central nervous system which influence the individual's ability to maintain-, process or convey information to others in an efficient way. A worldwide discussion about the definitions of LD continues while a conceptual framework for studying the diverse life outcomes of adults with LD is still missing.



Objective
The aim was to review the literature on the activity and participation of adults with LD based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) concepts.



Methods
“PsychInfo”, “Eric” and “PubMed” were searched for relevant literature according to the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). After a three-stage process, 62 articles relevant for domains of activity and participation of adults with LD were included in the review.



Results
Thirty-two articles focused on the domain of major life areas of education, work and employment and twelve articles focused on the domain of learning and applying knowledge. Limitations in activity and participation of the population with LD in these domains are recognized and discussed. Eighteen additional articles demonstrated that adults with LD confront difficulties in various life domains (e.g., communication, interpersonal interactions, mobility, and domestic life), however literature concerning these domains is scarce.



Conclusions
The ICF can be useful for further exploration of activity and participation characteristics of adults with LD in various life domains. Such exploration is required in order to gain a wider perspective of their functional characteristics and daily needs.",11,"['were searched', 'were included', 'are recognized and discussed.', 'is required']",4,4,0.36363636363636365,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0106657,Activity and Participation Characteristics of Adults with Learning Disabilities - A Systematic Review
"Abstract

Background
‘Self-objectification’ is the tendency to experience one's body principally as an object, to be evaluated for its appearance rather than for its effectiveness. Within objectification theory, it has been proposed that self-objectification accounts for the poorer interoceptive awareness observed in women, as measured by heartbeat perception. Our study is, we believe, the first specifically to test this relationship.



Methodology/Principal Findings
Using a well-validated and reliable heartbeat perception task, we measured interoceptive awareness in women and compared this with their scores on the Self-Objectification Questionnaire, the Self-Consciousness Scale and the Body Consciousness Questionnaire. Interoceptive awareness was negatively correlated with self-objectification. Interoceptive awareness, public body consciousness and private body consciousness together explained 31% of the variance in self-objectification. However, private body consciousness was not significantly correlated with interoceptive awareness, which may explain the many nonsignificant results in self-objectification studies that have used private body consciousness as a measure of body awareness.



Conclusions/Significance
We propose interoceptive awareness, assessed by heartbeat perception, as a measure of body awareness in self-objectification studies. Our findings have implications for those clinical conditions, in women, which are characterised by self-objectification and low interoceptive awareness, such as eating disorders.",10,"['be evaluated', 'has been proposed', 'measured by heartbeat perception', 'was negatively correlated', 'was not significantly correlated', 'are characterised']",6,5,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055568,"Body Conscious?

Background
‘Taste’ changes are commonly reported during chemotherapy. It is unclear to what extent this relates to actual changes in taste function or to changes in appetite and food liking and how these changes affect dietary intake and nutritional status.



Patients and methods
This prospective, repeated measures cohort study recruited participants from three oncology clinics. Women (n = 52) prescribed adjuvant chemotherapy underwent standardised testing of taste perception, appetite and food liking at six time points to measure change from baseline. Associations between taste and hedonic changes and nutritional outcomes were examined.



Results
Taste function was significantly reduced early in chemotherapy cycles (p<0.05) but showed recovery by late in the cycle. Ability to correctly identify salty, sour and umami tastants was reduced. Liking of sweet food decreased early and mid-cycle (p<0.01) but not late cycle. Liking of savory food was not significantly affected. Appetite decreased early in the cycle (p<0.001). Reduced taste function was associated with lowest kilojoule intake (r = 0.31; p = 0.008) as was appetite loss with reduced kilojoule (r = 0.34; p = 0.002) and protein intake (r = 0.36; p = 0.001) early in the third chemotherapy cycle. Decreased appetite early in the third and final chemotherapy cycles was associated with a decline in BMI (p = <0.0005) over the study period. Resolution of taste function, food liking and appetite was observed 8 weeks after chemotherapy completion. There was no association between taste change and dry mouth, oral mucositis or nausea.



Conclusion
The results reveal, for the first time, the cyclical yet transient effects of adjuvant chemotherapy on taste function and the link between taste and hedonic changes, dietary intake and nutritional outcomes. The results should be used to inform reliable pre-chemotherapy education.",16,"['are commonly reported', 'were examined', 'was significantly reduced', 'was reduced', 'was not significantly affected', 'was observed', 'should be used']",7,7,0.4375,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0103512,"A Prospective Cohort Study of the Effects of Adjuvant Breast Cancer Chemotherapy on Taste Function, Food Liking, Appetite and Associated Nutritional Outcomes"
"Abstract

Background
‘Treatment burden’, defined as both the workload and impact of treatment regimens on function and well-being, has been associated with poor adherence and unfavourable outcomes. Previous research focused on treatment workload but our understanding of treatment impact is limited. This research aimed to systematically review qualitative research to identify: 1) what are the treatment generated disruptions experienced by patients across all chronic conditions and treatments? 2) what strategies do patients employ to minimise these treatment generated disruptions?



Methods and Findings
The search strategy centred on: treatment burden and qualitative methods. Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and PsychINFO were searched electronically from inception to Dec 2013. No language limitations were set. Teams of two reviewers independently conducted paper screening, data extraction, and data analysis. Data were analysed using framework synthesis informed by Cumulative Complexity Model. Eleven papers reporting data from 294 patients, across a range of conditions, age groups and nationalities were included. Treatment burdens were experienced as a series of disruptions: biographical disruptions involved loss of freedom and independence, restriction of meaningful activities, negative emotions and stigma; relational disruptions included strained family and social relationships and feeling isolated; and, biological disruptions involved physical side-effects. Patients employed “adaptive treatment work” and “rationalised non-adherence” to minimise treatment disruptions. Rationalised non-adherence was sanctioned by health professionals at end of life; at other times it was a “secret-act” which generated feelings of guilt and impacted on family and clinical relationships.



Conclusions
Treatments generate negative emotions and physical side effects, strain relationships and affect identity. Patients minimise these disruptions through additional adaptive work and/or by non-adherence. This affects physical outcomes and care relationships. There is a need for clinicians to engage with patients in honest conversations about treatment disruptions and the ‘adhere-ability’ of recommended regimens. Patient-centred practice requires management plans which optimise outcomes and minimise disruptions.",16,"['disruptions experienced', 'strategy centred', 'were searched', 'were set', 'were analysed', 'were included', 'were experienced', 'was sanctioned']",8,7,0.4375,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0125457,"Living With, Managing and Minimising Treatment Burden in Long Term Conditions: A Systematic Review of Qualitative Research"

Background
“Casual sex” is seldom as non-selective and random as it may sound. During each sexual encounter, people consciously and unconsciously seek their casual sex partners according to different attributes. Influential to a sexual network, research focusing on quantifying the effects of physical appearance on sexual network has been sparse.



Methods
We evaluated the application of Log odds score (LOD) to assess the mixing patterns of 326 men who have sex with men (MSM) in Hong Kong in their networking of casual sex partners by Body Image Type (BIT). This involved an analysis of 1,196 respondents-casual sex partner pairs. Seven BITs were used in the study: Bear, Chubby, Slender, Lean toned, Muscular, Average and Other.



Results
A hierarchical pattern was observed in the preference of MSM for casual sex partners by the latter's BIT. Overall, Muscular men were most preferred, followed by Lean toned while the least preferred was Slender, as illustrated by LOD going down along the hierarchy in the same direction. Marked avoidance was found between men who self-identified as Chubby and men of Other body type (within-group-LOD: 1.25–2.89; between-group-LOD: <−1). None of the respondents reported to have networked a man who self-identified as Average for casual sex.



Conclusions
We have demonstrated the possibility of adopting a mathematical prototype to investigate the influence of BIT in a sexual network of MSM. Construction of matrix based on culture-specific BIT and cross-cultural comparisons would generate new knowledge on the mixing behaviors of MSM.",13,"['were used', 'was observed', 'illustrated by lod going down along the hierarchy in the same direction', 'was found']",4,4,0.3076923076923077,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0113791,A New Perspective on Sexual Mixing among Men Who Have Sex with Men by Body Image

Background
“Horizontal strokes should be level and vertical strokes should be straight” is a common guideline in the teaching of Chinese handwriting. Measuring deviations in level horizontal and straight vertical strokes in students’ Chinese handwriting is usually assessed manually. However, this task is time-consuming and may have inconsistent outcomes when judged by different people. In this paper, we aim to formulate a method to automatically evaluate the tilt and slant degrees of students’ Chinese handwriting using digital handwriting tablets. Furthermore, we analyze the relationship between the tilt and slant features of students’ Chinese handwriting and other demographic and handwriting features.



Methods
Five hundred and ninety-one primary school students from grades 1 to 6 were recruited in Hong Kong. Before the assessment, a grid paper was attached to a digital handwriting tablet. The participants were then asked to copy 90 Chinese characters from a template to the grid paper. Their handwriting processes were recorded as two-dimensional points and then analyzed. The tilt and slant of the students’ handwriting were calculated based on the inclination level of their horizontal and vertical strokes. Linear regressions between slant/tilt degree of the manuscripts and other handwriting features were performed. The students’ demographic information was also explored.



Results
Slant was found to be significantly correlated to Gender (p < 0.001) and tilt×standard deviation of pen pressure (p < 0.001). Tilt was found to be significantly correlated to ground time (p < 0.001), slant (p < 0.001) and slant×special education need (p = 0.021).



Conclusions
Our results demonstrate the relationship between slant, tilt and Chinese handwriting performance in primary school children. Slant and tilt can be adopted as an indicator in students’ special education need diagnosis, as tilt level in the students’ Chinese handwriting was related to ground time and slant× special education need, while slant is related to tilt×standard deviation of pen pressure and female students. These findings may also inspire ways to increase special education need students’ writing speed.",17,"['is usually assessed', 'judged by different people', 'were recruited', 'was attached', 'were then asked', 'were recorded', 'were calculated', 'were performed', 'was also explored', 'was found', 'be significantly correlated', 'was found', 'be significantly correlated', 'can be adopted', 'was related', 'is related']",16,12,0.7058823529411765,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223485,Measuring the tilt and slant of Chinese handwriting in primary school students: A computerized approach
"Abstract

Background
“Imaging genetics” studies have shown that brain function by neuroimaging is a sensitive intermediate phenotype that bridges the gap between genes and psychiatric conditions. Although the evidence of association between functional val108/158met polymorphism of the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene (COMT) and increasing risk for developing schizophrenia from genetic association studies remains to be elucidated, one of the most topical findings from imaging genetics studies is the association between COMT genotype and prefrontal function in schizophrenia. The next important step in the translational approach is to establish a useful neuroimaging tool in clinical settings that is sensitive to COMT variation, so that the clinician could use the index to predict clinical response such as improvement in cognitive dysfunction by medication. Here, we investigated spatiotemporal characteristics of the association between prefrontal hemodynamic activation and the COMT genotype using a noninvasive neuroimaging technique, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).



Methodology/Principal Findings
Study participants included 45 patients with schizophrenia and 60 healthy controls matched for age and gender. Signals that are assumed to reflect regional cerebral blood volume were monitored over prefrontal regions from 52-channel NIRS and compared between two COMT genotype subgroups (Met carriers and Val/Val individuals) matched for age, gender, premorbid IQ, and task performance. The [oxy-Hb] increase in the Met carriers during the verbal fluency task was significantly greater than that in the Val/Val individuals in the frontopolar prefrontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia, although neither medication nor clinical symptoms differed significantly between the two subgroups. These differences were not found to be significant in healthy controls.



Conclusions/Significance
These data suggest that the prefrontal NIRS signals can noninvasively detect the impact of COMT variation in patients with schizophrenia. NIRS may be a promising candidate translational approach in psychiatric neuroimaging.",9,"['be elucidated', 'are assumed', 'were monitored', 'were not found']",4,3,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005495,Association between Catechol-O-Methyltrasferase Val108/158Met Genotype and Prefrontal Hemodynamic Response in Schizophrenia
"Abstract

Background
“Nudging”—modifying environments to change people’s behavior, often without their conscious awareness—can improve health, but public acceptability of nudging is largely unknown.



Methods
We compared acceptability, in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA), of government interventions to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. Three nudge interventions were assessed: i. reducing portion Size, ii. changing the Shape of the drink containers, iii. changing their shelf Location; alongside two traditional interventions: iv. Taxation and v. Education. We also tested the hypothesis that describing interventions as working through non-conscious processes decreases their acceptability. Predictors of acceptability, including perceived intervention effectiveness, were also assessed. Participants (n = 1093 UK and n = 1082 USA) received a description of each of the five interventions which varied, by randomisation, in how the interventions were said to affect behaviour: (a) via conscious processes; (b) via non-conscious processes; or (c) no process stated. Acceptability was derived from responses to three items.



Results
Levels of acceptability for four of the five interventions did not differ significantly between the UK and US samples; reducing portion size was less accepted by the US sample. Within each country, Education was rated as most acceptable and Taxation the least, with the three nudge-type interventions rated between these. There was no evidence to support the study hypothesis: i.e. stating that interventions worked via non-conscious processes did not decrease their acceptability in either the UK or US samples. Perceived effectiveness was the strongest predictor of acceptability for all interventions across the two samples.



Conclusion
In conclusion, nudge interventions to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages seem similarly acceptable in the UK and USA, being more acceptable than taxation, but less acceptable than education. Contrary to prediction, we found no evidence that highlighting the non-conscious processes by which nudge interventions may work decreases their acceptability. However, highlighting the effectiveness of all interventions has the potential to increase their acceptability.",12,"['were assessed', 'were also assessed', 'were said', 'was derived', 'was rated']",5,5,0.4166666666666667,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0155995,Public Acceptability in the UK and USA of Nudging to Reduce Obesity: The Example of Reducing Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Consumption

Background
1.5 million Kenyans are living with HIV/AIDS as per 2015 estimates. Though there is a notable decline in new HIV infections, continued effort is still needed to develop an efficacious, accessible and affordable HIV vaccine. HIV vaccine clinical trials bear risks, hence a need to understand volunteer motivators for enrolment, retention and follow-up. Understanding the factors that motivate volunteers to participate in a clinical trial can help to strategize, refine targeting and thus increase enrolment of volunteers in future HIV vaccine clinical trials. The health belief model classifies motivators into social benefits such as ‘advancing research’ and collaboration with science, and personal benefits such as health benefits and financial interests.



Method
A thematic analysis was carried out on data obtained from four HIV clinical trials conducted at KAVI-Institute of Clinical Research in Nairobi Kenya from 2009 to 2015. Responses were obtained from a Questionnaire administered to the volunteers during their screening visit at the research site.



Results
Of the 281 healthy, HIV-uninfected volunteers participating in this study; 38% were motivated by personal benefits including, 31% motivated by health benefits and 7% motivated by possible financial gains. In addition, 62% of the volunteers were motivated by social benefits with 20% of who were seeking to help their family/society/world while 42% were interested in advancing research.



Conclusion
The majority of volunteers in the HIV vaccine trials at our site were motivated by social benefits, suggesting that altruism can be a major contributor to participation in HIV vaccine studies. Personal benefits were a secondary motivator for the volunteers. The motivators to volunteer in HIV clinical trials were similar across ages, education level and gender. Education on what is needed (including volunteer participation) to develop an efficacious vaccine could be the key to greater volunteer motivation to participate in HIV vaccine clinical trials.",13,"['is still needed', 'was carried', 'were obtained', 'were motivated', 'were motivated', 'were motivated', 'is needed']",7,7,0.5384615384615384,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0183788,"Volunteer motivators for participating in HIV vaccine clinical trials in Nairobi, Kenya"

Background
10 Hz conditioning electrical stimulation (CES) has been shown to induce long-term potentiation (LTP)-like pain amplification similar to traditional 100 Hz CES in healthy humans. The aim of this study was to assess the test-retest reliability and to estimate sample sizes required for future crossover and parallel study designs.



Methods
The 10 Hz paradigm (500 rectangular pulses lasting 50 s) was repeated on two separate days with one week interval in twenty volunteers. Perceptual intensities to single electrical stimulation (SES) at the conditioned skin site and to mechanical stimuli (pinprick and light stroking) in immediate vicinity to the conditioned skin site were recorded. Superficial blood flow (SBF) was assessed as indicator of neurogenic inflammation. All outcome measures were assessed with 10 min interval three times before and six times after the CES. The coefficient of variation and intra-class correlation coefficient were calculated within session and between sessions. Sample sizes were estimated for future crossover (Ncr) and parallel (Np) drug testing studies expected to detect a 30% decrease for the individual outcome measure following 10 Hz CES.



Results
Perceptual intensity ratings to light stroking (Ncr = 2, Np = 33) and pinprick stimulation (491 mN) (Ncr = 6, Np = 54) increased after CES and showed better reliability in crossover than parallel design. The SBF increased after CES, and then declined until reaching a plateau 20 minutes postCES. SBF showed acceptable reliability both in crossover and parallel designs (Ncr = 3, Np = 13). Pain ratings to SES were reliable, but with large estimated sample sizes (Ncr = 634, Np = 11310) due to the minor pain amplification.



Conclusions
The reliability of 10 Hz CES was acceptable in inducing LTP-like effects in the assessments of superficial blood flow, heterotopic mechanical hyperalgesia, and dysesthesia in terms of sample sizes for future crossover study designs.",13,"['has been shown', 'was repeated', 'were recorded', 'was assessed', 'were assessed', 'were calculated', 'were estimated']",7,7,0.5384615384615384,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161117,Test-Retest Reliability of 10 Hz Conditioning Electrical Stimulation Inducing Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)-Like Pain Amplification in Humans

Background
10–22% of individuals sustaining whiplash trauma develop persistent symptoms resulting in reduced working ability and decreased quality of life, but it is poorly understood why some people do not recover. Various collision and post-collision risk factors have been studied, but little is known about pre-collision risk factors. In particular, the impact of sickness and socioeconomic factors before the collision on recovery is sparsely explored. The aim of this study was to examine if welfare payments received within five years pre-collision predict neck pain and negative change in provisional situation one year post-collision.



Methods and Findings
719 individuals with acute whiplash trauma consecutively recruited from emergency departments or primary care after car accidents in Denmark completed questionnaires on socio-demographic and health factors immediately after the collision. After 12 months, a visual analogue scale on neck pain intensity was completed. 3595 matched controls in the general population were sampled, and national public register data on social benefits and any other welfare payments were obtained for participants with acute whiplash trauma and controls from five years pre-collision to 15 months after. Participants with acute whiplash trauma who had received sickness benefit for more than 12 weeks pre-collision had increased odds for negative change in future provisional situation (Odds Ratio (OR) (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 3.8 (2.1;7.1)) and future neck pain (OR (95%CI) = 3.3 (1.8;6.3)), controlling for other known risk factors. Participants with acute whiplash trauma had weaker attachment to labour market (more weeks of sick leave (χ2(2) = 36.7, p < 0.001) and unemployment (χ2(2) = 12.5, p = 0.002)) pre-collision compared with controls. Experiencing a whiplash trauma raised the odds for future negative change in provisional situation (OR (95%CI) = 3.1 (2.3;4.4)) compared with controls.



Conclusions
Sick leave before the collision strongly predicted prolonged recovery following whiplash trauma. Participants with acute whiplash trauma had weaker attachment to labour market pre-collision compared with the general population. Neck pain at inclusion predicted future neck pain. Acute whiplash trauma may trigger pre-existing vulnerabilities increasing risk of developing whiplash-associated disorders.",16,"['is poorly understood', 'have been studied', 'is known', 'is sparsely explored', 'was completed', 'were sampled', 'were obtained']",7,5,0.3125,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130298,Sick Leave within 5 Years of Whiplash Trauma Predicts Recovery: A Prospective Cohort and Register-Based Study

Background
22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS) represents one of the greatest known genetic risk factors for the development of psychotic illness, and is also associated with high rates of autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) in childhood. We performed integrated genomic analyses of 22q11DS to identify genes and pathways related to specific phenotypes.



Methods
We used a high-resolution aCGH array to precisely characterize deletion breakpoints. Using peripheral blood, we examined differential expression (DE) and networks of co-expressed genes related to phenotypic variation within 22q11DS patients. Whole-genome transcriptional profiling was performed using Illumina Human HT-12 microarrays. Data mining techniques were used to validate our results against independent samples of both peripheral blood and brain tissue from idiopathic psychosis and ASD cases.



Results
Eighty-five percent of 22q11DS individuals (N = 39) carried the typical 3 Mb deletion, with significant variability in deletion characteristics in the remainder of the sample (N = 7). DE analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified expression changes related to psychotic symptoms in patients, including a module of co-expressed genes which was associated with psychosis in 22q11DS and involved in pathways associated with transcriptional regulation. This module was enriched for brain-expressed genes, was not related to antipsychotic medication use, and significantly overlapped with transcriptional changes in idiopathic schizophrenia. In 22q11DS-ASD, both DE and WGCNA analyses implicated dysregulation of immune response pathways. The ASD-associated module showed significant overlap with genes previously associated with idiopathic ASD.



Conclusion
These findings further support the use of peripheral tissue in the study of major mutational models of diseases affecting the brain, and point towards specific pathways dysregulated in 22q11DS carriers with psychosis and ASD.",11,"['was performed', 'were used', 'was enriched', 'was not related']",4,3,0.2727272727272727,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132542,Transcriptome Profiling of Peripheral Blood in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome Reveals Functional Pathways Related to Psychosis and Autism Spectrum Disorder
"Abstract

Background
29 autoimmune diseases, including Rheumatoid Arthritis, gout, Crohn’s Disease, and Systematic Lupus Erythematosus affect 7.6-9.4% of the population. While effective therapy is available, many patients do not follow treatment or use medications as directed. Digital health and Web 2.0 interventions have demonstrated much promise in increasing medication and treatment adherence, but to date many Internet tools have proven disappointing. In fact, most digital interventions continue to suffer from high attrition in patient populations, are burdensome for healthcare professionals, and have relatively short life spans.



Objective
Digital health tools have traditionally centered on the transformation of existing interventions (such as diaries, trackers, stage-based or cognitive behavioral therapy programs, coupons, or symptom checklists) to electronic format. Advanced digital interventions have also incorporated attributes of Web 2.0 such as social networking, text messaging, and the use of video. Despite these efforts, there has not been little measurable impact in non-adherence for illnesses that require medical interventions, and research must look to other strategies or development methodologies. As a first step in investigating the feasibility of developing such a tool, the objective of the current study is to systematically rate factors of non-adherence that have been reported in past research studies.



Methods
Grounded Theory, recognized as a rigorous method that facilitates the emergence of new themes through systematic analysis, data collection and coding, was used to analyze quantitative, qualitative and mixed method studies addressing the following autoimmune diseases: Rheumatoid Arthritis, gout, Crohn’s Disease, Systematic Lupus Erythematosus, and inflammatory bowel disease. Studies were only included if they contained primary data addressing the relationship with non-adherence.



Results
Out of the 27 studies, four non-modifiable and 11 modifiable risk factors were discovered. Over one third of articles identified the following risk factors as common contributors to medication non-adherence (percent of studies reporting): patients not understanding treatment (44%), side effects (41%), age (37%), dose regimen (33%), and perceived medication ineffectiveness (33%). An unanticipated finding that emerged was the need for risk stratification tools (81%) with patient-centric approaches (67%).



Conclusions
This study systematically identifies and categorizes medication non-adherence risk factors in select autoimmune diseases. Findings indicate that patients understanding of their disease and the role of medication are paramount. An unexpected finding was that the majority of research articles called for the creation of tailored, patient-centric interventions that dispel personal misconceptions about disease, pharmacotherapy, and how the body responds to treatment. To our knowledge, these interventions do not yet exist in digital format. Rather than adopting a systems level approach, digital health programs should focus on cohorts with heterogeneous needs, and develop tailored interventions based on individual non-adherence patterns.",18,"['have been reported', 'was used', 'were only included', 'were discovered']",4,4,0.2222222222222222,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129364,Targeting Medication Non-Adherence Behavior in Selected Autoimmune Diseases: A Systematic Approach to Digital Health Program Development

Background
A 7.0-magnitude earthquake hit Lushan County in China’s Sichuan province on April 20, 2013, resulting in 196 deaths and 11,470 injured. This study was designed to analyze the characteristics of the injuries and the treatment of the seismic victims.



Methods
After the earthquake, an epidemiological survey of injured patients was conducted by the Health Department of Sichuan Province. Epidemiological survey tools included paper-and-pencil questionnaires and a data management system based on the Access Database. Questionnaires were completed based on the medical records of inpatients with earthquake-related injuries. Outpatients or non-seismic injured inpatients were excluded. A total of 2010 patients from 140 hospitals were included.



Results
The most common type of injuries involved bone fractures (58.3%). Children younger than 10 years of age suffered fewer fractures and chest injuries, but more skin and soft -tissue injuries. Patients older than 80 years were more likely to suffer hip and thigh fractures, pelvis fractures, and chest injuries, whereas adult patients suffered more ankle and foot fractures. A total of 207 cases of calcaneal fracture were due to high falling injuries related to extreme panic. The most common type of infection in hospitalized patients was pulmonary infections. A total of 70.5% patients had limb dysfunction, and 60.1% of this group received rehabilitation. Most patients received rehabilitation within 1 week, and the median duration of rehabilitation was 3 weeks. The cause of death of all seven hospitalized patients who died was severe traumatic brain injuries; five of this group died within 24 h after the earthquake.



Conclusions
Injuries varied as a function of the age of the victim. As more injuries were indirectly caused by the Lushan earthquake, disaster education is urgently needed to avoid secondary injuries.",17,"['was designed', 'was conducted', 'were completed', 'were excluded', 'were included', 'caused by the lushan earthquake', 'is urgently needed']",7,6,0.35294117647058826,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0097416,Epidemiological Analysis of Trauma Patients following the Lushan Earthquake
"Abstract

Background
A basic premise of the recently proffered color-in-context model is that the influence of color on psychological functioning varies as a function of the psychological context in which color is perceived. Some research has examined the appetitive and aversive implications of viewing the color red in romance- and achievement-relevant contexts, respectively, but in all existing empirical work approach and avoidance behavior has been studied in separate tasks and separate experiments. Research is needed to directly test whether red influences the same behavior differently depending entirely on psychological context.



Methodology/Principal Findings
The present experiment was designed to put this premise to direct test in romance- and achievement-relevant contexts within the same experimental paradigm involving walking behavior. Our results revealed that exposure to red (but not blue) indeed has differential implications for walking behavior as a function of the context in which the color is perceived. Red increased the speed with which participants walked to an ostensible interview about dating (a romance-relevant context), but decreased the speed with which they walked to an ostensible interview about intelligence (an achievement-relevant context).



Conclusions/Significance
These results are the first direct evidence that the influence of red on psychological functioning in humans varies by psychological context. Our findings contribute to both the literature on color psychology and the broader, emerging literature on the influence of context on basic psychological processes.",8,"['is perceived', 'has been studied', 'is needed', 'was designed', 'is perceived']",5,5,0.625,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0040333,Color in Context: Psychological Context Moderates the Influence of Red on Approach- and Avoidance-Motivated Behavior
"Abstract

Background
A Body Shape Index (ABSI) had been derived from a study of the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2004 mortality data to quantify the risk associated with abdominal obesity (as indicated by a wide waist relative to height and body mass index). A national survey with longer follow-up, the British Health and Lifestyle Survey (HALS), provides another opportunity to assess the predictive power for mortality of ABSI. HALS also includes repeat observations, allowing estimation of the implications of changes in ABSI.



Methods and Findings
We evaluate ABSI z score relative to population normals as a predictor of all-cause mortality over 24 years of follow-up to HALS. We found that ABSI is a strong indicator of mortality hazard in this population, with death rates increasing by a factor of 1.13 (95% confidence interval, 1.09–1.16) per standard deviation increase in ABSI and a hazard ratio of 1.61 (1.40–1.86) for those with ABSI in the top 20% of the population compared to those with ABSI in the bottom 20%. Using the NHANES normals to compute ABSI z scores gave similar results to using z scores derived specifically from the HALS sample. ABSI outperformed as a predictor of mortality hazard other measures of abdominal obesity such as waist circumference, waist to height ratio, and waist to hip ratio. Moreover, it was a consistent predictor of mortality hazard over at least 20 years of follow-up. Change in ABSI between two HALS examinations 7 years apart also predicted mortality hazard: individuals with a given initial ABSI who had rising ABSI were at greater risk than those with falling ABSI.



Conclusions
ABSI is a readily computed dynamic indicator of health whose correlation with lifestyle and with other risk factors and health outcomes warrants further investigation.",11,"['had been derived', 'indicated by a wide waist relative to height and body mass index']",2,1,0.09090909090909091,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088793,Dynamic Association of Mortality Hazard with Body Shape

Background
A brief psychodynamic interpersonal therapy (PIT) in patients with multisomatoform disorder has been recently shown to improve health-related quality of life.



Aims
To assess cost-effectiveness of PIT compared to enhanced medical care in patients with multisomatoform disorder.



Method
An economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial (International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number ISRCTN23215121) conducted in 6 German academic outpatient centres was performed. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated from the statutory health insurance perspective on the basis of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained at 12 months. Uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness of PIT was presented by means of a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve.



Results
Based on the complete-case analysis ICER was 41840 Euro per QALY. The results did not change greatly with the use of multiple imputation (ICER = 44222) and last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach to missing data (ICER = 46663). The probability of PIT being cost-effective exceeded 50% for thresholds of willingness to pay over 35 thousand Euros per QALY.



Conclusions
Cost-effectiveness of PIT is highly uncertain for thresholds of willingness to pay under 35 thousand Euros per QALY.",9,"['has been recently shown', 'was performed', 'was calculated', 'was presented']",4,4,0.4444444444444444,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0083894,Economic Evaluation of Brief Psychodynamic Interpersonal Therapy in Patients with Multisomatoform Disorder

Background
A cancer disease can affect the satisfaction with the physical appearance, so that the standardized assessment of the body image is important in cancer patients. The German version of the Self-Image Scale is a self-report measure that uses two subscales to assess appearance satisfaction (self-acceptance) and perceptions of partners’ acceptance of their appearance (partner-acceptance). The present study aimed to validate the Self-Image Scale’s two-factor structure in a sample of cancer patients with a variety of different diagnoses to further increase its utility.



Methods
Confirmatory factor analysis methods were used to examine the two-factor model in a sample of cancer patients (N = 278). Scale reliability and validity were then assessed through internal consistency measures and correlations with external criteria such as depressiveness, anxiety, distress, and relationship satisfaction.



Results
The proposed factor structure was supported by the results and the internal consistencies were good with α = .83 for the self-acceptance scale and α = .88 for the partner-acceptance scale while additional correlations with external criteria were observed as expected.

"Abstract

Background
A causal relationship between maternal obesity and offspring asthma is hypothesized to begin during early development, but no underlying mechanism for the found association is identified. We quantitatively examined mediation by offspring body mass index (BMI) in the association of maternal pre-pregnancy BMI on risk of asthma and wheezing during the first 7–8 years of life in a large Amsterdam born birth cohort.



Methods
For 3185 mother-child pairs, mothers reported maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and offspring outcomes “ever being diagnosed with asthma” and “wheezing in the past 12 months” on questionnaires. We measured offspring height and weight at age 5–6 years. We performed a multivariate log linear regression comparing outcomes in offspring of mothers with different BMI categories. For each category we quantified and tested mediation by offspring BMI and also investigated interaction by parental asthma.



Results
At the age of 7–8 years, 8% of the offspring ever had asthma and 7% had current wheezing. Maternal pre-pregnancy obesity was associated with higher risks of asthma (adjusted RR 2.32 (95% CI: 1.49–3.61) and wheezing (adjusted RR 2.16 (95% CI: 1.28–3.64). Offspring BMI was a mediator in the association between maternal BMI and offspring wheezing, but not for asthma. There was no interaction by parental asthma.



Conclusions
Maternal pre-pregnancy obesity was associated with higher risks of offspring asthma and wheezing. The association between maternal obesity and offspring wheezing was both direct and indirect (mediated) through the child’s own BMI.",12,"['is hypothesized', 'is identified', 'being diagnosed']",3,2,0.16666666666666666,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140641,A Study on Mediation by Offspring BMI in the Association between Maternal Obesity and Child Respiratory Outcomes in the Amsterdam Born and Their Development Study Cohort
"Abstract

Background
A child’s obesity is generally perceived by the public to be under the control of the child’s parents. While the health consequences of childhood obesity are well understood, less is known about psychological and social effects of having an obese child on parents. We set out to characterize stigma and courtesy stigma experiences surrounding obesity among children with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a multisystem genetic disorder, and their parents.



Methods
Twenty-eight parents of children with BBS participated in semi-structured interviews informed by social stigmatization theory, which describes courtesy stigma as parental perception of stigmatization by association with a stigmatized child. Parents were asked to describe such experiences.



Results
Parents of children with BBS reported the child’s obesity as the most frequent target of stigmatization. They perceived health care providers as the predominant source of courtesy stigma, describing interactions that resulted in feeling devalued and judged as incompetent parents.



Conclusions
Parents of children with BBS feel blamed by others for their child’s obesity and described experiences that suggest health care providers may contribute to courtesy stigma and thus impede effective communication about managing obesity. Health care providers may reinforce parental feelings of guilt and responsibility by repeating information parents may have previously heard and ignoring extremely challenging barriers to weight management, such as a genetic predisposition to obesity. Strategies to understand and incorporate parents’ perceptions and causal attributions of their children’s weight may improve communication about weight control.",10,"['is generally perceived', 'are well understood', 'is known', 'were asked', 'feel blamed']",5,4,0.4,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140705,Characterization of Courtesy Stigma Perceived by Parents of Overweight Children with Bardet-Biedl Syndrome
"Abstract

Background
A classification image (CI) technique has shown that static luminance noise near visually completed contours affects the discrimination of fat and thin Kanizsa shapes. These influential noise regions were proposed to reveal “behavioral receptive fields” of completed contours–the same regions to which early cortical cells respond in neurophysiological studies of contour completion. Here, we hypothesized that 1) influential noise regions correspond to the surfaces that distinguish fat and thin shapes (hereafter, key regions); and 2) key region noise biases a “fat” response to the extent that its contrast polarity (lighter or darker than background) matches the shape's filled-in surface color.



Results
To test our hypothesis, we had observers discriminate fat and thin noise-embedded rectangles that were defined by either illusory or luminance-defined contours (Experiment 1). Surrounding elements (“inducers”) caused the shapes to appear either lighter or darker than the background–a process sometimes referred to as lightness induction. For both illusory and luminance-defined rectangles, key region noise biased a fat response to the extent that its contrast polarity (light or dark) matched the induced surface color. When lightness induction was minimized, luminance noise had no consistent influence on shape discrimination. This pattern arose when pixels immediately adjacent to the discriminated boundaries were excluded from the analysis (Experiment 2) and also when the noise was restricted to the key regions so that the noise never overlapped with the physically visible edges (Experiment 3). The lightness effects did not occur in the absence of enclosing boundaries (Experiment 4).



Conclusions
Under noisy conditions, lightness induction alters visually completed shape. Moreover, behavioral receptive fields derived in CI studies do not correspond to contours per se but to filled-in surface regions contained by those contours. The relevance of lightness to two-dimensional shape completion supplies a new constraint for models of object perception.",12,"['were proposed', 'were defined', 'was minimized', 'were excluded', 'was restricted']",5,4,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062505,Reinterpreting Behavioral Receptive Fields: Lightness Induction Alters Visually Completed Shape
"Abstract

Background
A common registration problem for the application of consumer device is to align all the acquired image sequences into a complete scene. Image alignment requires a registration algorithm that will compensate as much as possible for geometric variability among images. However, images captured views from a real scene usually produce different distortions. Some are derived from the optic characteristics of image sensors, and others are caused by the specific scenes and objects.



Methodology/Principal Findings
An image registration algorithm considering the perspective projection is proposed for the application of consumer devices in this study. It exploits a multiresolution wavelet-based method to extract significant features. An analytic differential approach is then proposed to achieve fast convergence of point matching. Finally, the registration accuracy is further refined to obtain subpixel precision by a feature-based modified Levenberg-Marquardt method. Due to its feature-based and nonlinear characteristic, it converges considerably faster than most other methods. In addition, vignette compensation and color difference adjustment are also performed to further improve the quality of registration results.



Conclusions/Significance
The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by testing the synthetic and real images acquired by a hand-held digital still camera and in comparison with two registration techniques in terms of the squared sum of intensity differences (SSD) and correlation coefficient (CC). The results indicate that the proposed method is promising in registration accuracy and quality, which are statistically significantly better than other two approaches.",12,"['are derived', 'are caused', 'is proposed', 'is then proposed', 'are also performed', 'is evaluated']",6,5,0.4166666666666667,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0040558,Registration Accuracy and Quality of Real-Life Images
"Abstract

Background
A community’s cultural beliefs, attitudes and discourse can affect their responses in surveys. Knowledge of these cultural factors and how to comply with them or adjust for them during data collection can improve data quality.



Objective
This study describes implications of features of Gambian culture related to women’s reproductive health, and mortality, when collecting data in surveys.



Methods
13 in-depth interviews of female interviewers and a focus group discussion among male interviewers were conducted in two rural health and demographic surveillance systems as well as three key informant interviews in three regions in The Gambia.



Results
From the fieldworker’s viewpoint, questions relating to reproduction were best asked by women as culturally pregnancies should be concealed, and menstruation is considered a sensitive topic. Gambians were reluctant to speak about decedents and the Fula did not like to be counted, potentially affecting estimation of mortality. Asking about siblings proved problematic among the Fula and Serahule communities. Proposals made to overcome these challenges were that culturally-appropriate metaphors and symbols should be used to discuss sensitive matters and to enumerating births/deaths singly instead of collecting summary totals, which had threatening connotations. This was as opposed to training interviewers to ask standardised and precise verbatim questions.



Contribution
This paper presents indigenous Gambian solutions by fieldworkers to culturally sensitive topics when collecting pregnancy outcomes and mortality data in demographic and health surveys. For researchers collecting maternal mortality data, it highlights the potential shortcomings of the sibling history methodology.",11,"['were conducted', 'should be concealed', 'is considered', 'be counted', 'should be used']",5,4,0.36363636363636365,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0216924,"Gambian cultural beliefs, attitudes and discourse on reproductive health and mortality: Implications for data collection in surveys from the interviewer’s perspective"
"Abstract

Background
A compulsivity spectrum has been hypothesized to exist across Obsessive-Compulsive disorder (OCD), Eating Disorders (ED), substance abuse (SA) and binge-drinking (BD). The objective was to examine the validity of this compulsivity spectrum, and differentiate it from an externalizing behaviors dimension, but also to look at hypothesized personality and neural correlates.



Method
A community-sample of adolescents (N=1938; mean age 14.5 years), and their parents were recruited via high-schools in 8 European study sites. Data on adolescents’ psychiatric symptoms, DSM diagnoses (DAWBA) and substance use behaviors (AUDIT and ESPAD) were collected through adolescent- and parent-reported questionnaires and interviews.  The phenotypic structure of compulsive behaviors was then tested using structural equation modeling.  The model was validated using personality variables (NEO-FFI and TCI), and Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) analysis.



Results
Compulsivity symptoms best fit a higher-order two factor model, with ED and OCD loading onto a compulsivity factor, and BD and SA loading onto an externalizing factor, composed also of ADHD and conduct disorder symptoms.  The compulsivity construct correlated with neuroticism (r=0.638; p≤0.001), conscientiousness (r=0.171; p≤0.001), and brain gray matter volume in left and right orbitofrontal cortex, right ventral striatum and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The externalizing factor correlated with extraversion (r=0.201; p≤0.001), novelty-seeking (r=0.451; p≤0.001), and negatively with gray matter volume in the left inferior and middle frontal gyri.



Conclusions
Results suggest that a compulsivity spectrum exists in an adolescent, preclinical sample and accounts for variance in both OCD and ED, but not substance-related behaviors, and can be differentiated from an externalizing spectrum.",10,"['has been hypothesized', 'were recruited', 'were collected', 'was then tested', 'was validated', 'can be differentiated']",6,6,0.6,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0080151,A Phenotypic Structure and Neural Correlates of Compulsive Behaviors in Adolescents
"Abstract

Background
A considerable percentage of multiple sclerosis patients have attentional impairment, but understanding its neurophysiological basis remains a challenge. The Attention Network Test allows 3 attentional networks to be studied. Previous behavioural studies using this test have shown that the alerting network is impaired in multiple sclerosis. The aim of this study was to identify neurophysiological indexes of the attention impairment in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients using this test.



Results
After general slowing had been removed in patients group to isolate the effects of each condition, some behavioral differences between them were obtained. About Contingent Negative Variation, a statistically significant decrement were found in the amplitude for Central and Spatial Cue Conditions for patient group (p<0.05). ANOVAs showed for the patient group a significant latency delay for P1 and N1 components (p<0.05) and a decrease of P3 amplitude for congruent and incongruent stimuli (p<0.01). With regard to correlation analysis, PASAT-3s and SDMT showed significant correlations with behavioral measures of the Attention Network Test (p<0.01) and an ERP parameter (CNV amplitude).



Conclusions
Behavioral data are highly correlated with the neuropsychological scores and show that the alerting and orienting mechanisms in the patient group were impaired. Reduced amplitude for the Contingent Negative Variation in the patient group suggests that this component could be a physiological marker related to the alerting and orienting impairment in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. P1 and N1 delayed latencies are evidence of the demyelination process that causes impairment in the first steps of the visual sensory processing. Lastly, P3 amplitude shows a general decrease for the pathological group probably indexing a more central impairment. These results suggest that the Attention Network Test give evidence of multiple levels of attention impairment, which could help in the assessment and treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients.",13,"['be studied', 'had been removed', 'were obtained', 'were found', 'are highly correlated', 'marker related']",6,5,0.38461538461538464,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0097226,Neural Correlates of Alerting and Orienting Impairment in Multiple Sclerosis Patients
"Abstract

Background
A consistent association has been reported between low socioeconomic status (SES) and cardiovascular events (CE), whereas the association between SES and cerebrovascular events (CBVD) is less clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between SES (measured using education) and CE/CBVD in a cohort study, as well as to investigate lifestyle and clinical risk factors, to help to clarify the mechanisms by which SES influences CE/CBVD.



Material and Methods
We searched for diagnoses of CE and CBVD in the clinical records of 47,749 members of the EPICOR cohort (average follow-up time: 11 years). SES was determined by the relative index of inequality (RII).



Results
A total of 1,156 CE and 468 CBVD were found in the clinical records. An increased risk of CE was observed in the crude Cox model for the third tertile of RII compared to the first tertile (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21–1.61). The increased risk persisted after adjustment for lifestyle risk factors (HR = 1.19; 95%CI 1.02–1.38), clinical risk factors (HR = 1.35; 95%CI 1.17–1.56), and after full adjustment (HR = 1.17; 95%CI 1.01–1.37). Structural equation model showed that lifestyle rather than clinical risk factors are involved in the mechanisms by which education influences CE. No significant association was found between education and CBVD. A strong relationship was observed between education and diabetes at baseline.



Conclusion
The most important burden of inequality in CE incidence in Italy is due to lifestyle risk factors.",11,"['has been reported', 'was determined', 'were found', 'was observed', 'was found', 'was observed']",6,6,0.5454545454545454,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164130,The Association between Educational Level and Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases within the EPICOR Study: New Evidence for an Old Inequality Problem
"Abstract

Background
A continuous influx of poor people to urban slums poses a challenge to Bangladesh’s health system as it has failed to tackle maternal morbidity and mortality. BRAC is the largest non-governmental organisation in Bangladesh. BRAC has been working to reduce maternal, neonatal and under-five children morbidity and mortality of slum dwellers in cities. BRAC has been doing this work for a decade through a programme called MANOSHI. This programme provides door-to-door services to its beneficiaries through community health workers (CHWs) and normal delivery service through its delivery and maternity centres. BRAC started the ‘MANOSHI’ programme in Narayanganj City Corporation during 2011 to address maternal, neonatal and child health problems facing slum dwellers. We investigated the existing maternal health-service indicators in the slums of Narayanganj City Corporation and compared the findings with a non-intervention area.



Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted during 2012, in 47 slums of Narayanganj City Corporation as intervention and 10 slums of Narsingdi Sadar Municipality as comparison area. A total of 1206 married women, aged 15–49 years, with a pregnancy outcome in the previous year were included for interview. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, reproductive and maternal health-care practices like use of contraceptive methods, antenatal care (ANC), delivery care, postnatal care (PNC) were collected through a structured questionnaire. The chi-square test, Student t test, Mann Whitney U-test, factor analysis and log-binominal test were performed by using STATA statistical software for analysing data.



Results
The activities of BRAC CHWs significantly improved four or more ANC (47% vs. 21%; p<0.000) and PNC (48% vs. 39%; p<0.01) coverage in the intervention slums compared to comparison slums. Still, about half of the deliveries in both areas were attended at home by unskilled birth attendants, of which a very few received PNC within 48 hours after delivery. The poorest and illiterate women received fewer maternal health services from medically trained providers (MTPs). The poorest had a lower likelihood of receiving services from MTPs during delivery complications.



Conclusion
The MANOSHI programme service coverage for delivery care and PNC-checkup for women who prefer home delivery needs to be improved. For sustainable improvement of maternal health outcomes in urban slums, the programme needs to facilitate access to services for poor and illiterate women.",17,"['was conducted', 'were included', 'were collected', 'were performed', 'were attended', 'be improved']",6,6,0.35294117647058826,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162825,Evaluation of Maternal Health Service Indicators in Urban Slum of Bangladesh
"Abstract

Background
A core outcome set (COS) is a standardised collection of outcomes to be collected and reported in all trials within a research area. A COS can reduce reporting bias and facilitate evidence synthesis. This is currently unavailable for use in community-based bipolar trials. This research aimed to develop such a COS, with input from a full range of stakeholders.



Methods
A co-production approach was used throughout. A longlist of outcomes was derived from focus groups with people with a bipolar diagnosis and carers, interviews with healthcare professionals and a rapid review of outcomes listed in bipolar trials on the Cochrane database. An expert panel with personal and/or professional experience of bipolar participated in a modified Delphi process and the COS was finalised at a consensus meeting.



Results
Fifty participants rated the importance of each outcome. Sixty-six outcomes were included in Round 1 of the questionnaire; 13 outcomes were added by Round 1 participants and were rated in Round 2. Seventy-six percent of participants (n = 38) returned to Round 2 and 60 outcomes, including 4 outcomes added by participants in Round 1, received a rating of 7–9 by >70% and 1–3 by <25% of the sample. Fourteen participants finalised a COS containing 11 outcomes at the consensus meeting: personal recovery; connectedness; clinical recovery of bipolar symptoms; mental health and wellbeing; physical health; self-monitoring and management; medication effects; quality of life; service outcomes; experience of care; and use of coercion.



Conclusions
This COS is recommended for use in community-based bipolar trials to ensure stakeholder-relevant outcomes, facilitate data synthesis, and transparent reporting. The COS includes guidance notes for each outcome to allow the identification of suitable measurement instruments. Further validation is recommended for use with a wide range of communities and to achieve standardised measurement.",14,"['be collected', 'was used', 'was derived', 'was finalised', 'were included', 'were added', 'were rated', 'is recommended', 'is recommended']",9,7,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240518,Development of a core outcome set for use in community-based bipolar trials—A qualitative study and modified Delphi
"Abstract

Background
A core outcome set (COS) is a standardised set of outcomes which should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all effectiveness trials for a specific health area. This will allow results of studies to be compared, contrasted and combined as appropriate, as well as ensuring that all trials contribute usable information. The COMET (Core Outcome Measures for Effectiveness Trials) Initiative aims to support the development, reporting and adoption of COS. Central to this is a publically accessible online resource, populated with all available COS. The aim of the review we report here was to identify studies that sought to determine which outcomes or domains to measure in all clinical trials in a specific condition and to describe the methodological techniques used in these studies.



Methods
We developed a multi-faceted search strategy for electronic databases (MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Methodology Register). We included studies that sought to determine which outcomes/domains to measure in all clinical trials in a specific condition.



Results
A total of 250 reports relating to 198 studies were judged eligible for inclusion in the review. Studies covered various areas of health, most commonly cancer, rheumatology, neurology, heart and circulation, and dentistry and oral health. A variety of methods have been used to develop COS, including semi-structured discussion, unstructured group discussion, the Delphi Technique, Consensus Development Conference, surveys and Nominal Group Technique. The most common groups involved were clinical experts and non-clinical research experts. Thirty-one (16%) studies reported that the public had been involved in the process. The geographic locations of participants were predominantly North America (n = 164; 83%) and Europe (n = 150; 76%).



Conclusions
This systematic review identified many health areas where a COS has been developed, but also highlights important gaps. It is a further step towards a comprehensive, up-to-date database of COS. In addition, it shows the need for methodological guidance, including how to engage key stakeholder groups, particularly members of the public.",16,"['should be measured', 'be compared', 'were judged', 'have been used', 'has been developed']",5,5,0.3125,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0099111,Choosing Important Health Outcomes for Comparative Effectiveness Research: A Systematic Review
"Abstract

Background
A Core Outcome Set (COS) is an agreed list of outcomes that are measured and reported in all clinical trials for a particular health condition. An ‘e-Delphi’ is an increasingly popular method for developing a COS whereby stakeholders are consulted via a multi-round online survey to reach agreement regarding the most important outcomes. Many COS studies seek diverse, international input that includes professionals and healthcare users. However, the recruitment and retention of participants can be deterred by various factors (e.g. language barriers and iterative, time-consuming rounds). This report evaluates the effectiveness of recruitment and retention methods used in the Core Outcome Measures in Tinnitus International Delphi (COMiT’ID) study using participant feedback from healthcare users, healthcare practitioners, researchers, commercial representatives and funders.



Methods
A range of methods were applied to recruit participants to the study and maintain engagement over the three rounds. Feedback on recruitment and retention methods was collected using a twenty-item online questionnaire, with free text comments.



Results
A personalised email invitation was the most frequent recruitment route, and 719 professionals and healthcare users consented to take part. Retention of each stakeholder group ranged from 76 to 91% completing all three e-Delphi rounds. Feedback was given by 379 respondents. A majority of respondents were satisfied with the study methods that were implemented to promote retention. Over 55% indicated that their overall experience closely matched their expectations at the start of the study, and over 90% felt that their contribution was appreciated.



Conclusions
This report highlights study methods that worked well with respect to recruitment and retention, and those that did not. Findings provide a unique contribution to the growing evidence base of good practice in COS development by demonstrating the relative effectiveness of recruitment and retention methods for an e-Delphi survey.

"Abstract

Background
A COS represents an agreed minimum set of outcomes that should be measured and reported in all trials of a specific condition. The COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials) initiative aims to collate and stimulate the development and application of COS, by including data on relevant studies within a publically available internet-based resource. In recent years, there has been an interest in increasing the development of COS. Therefore, this study aimed to provide an update of a previous review, and examine the quality of development of COS. A further aim was to understand the reasons why individuals are searching the COMET database.



Methods
A multi-faceted search strategy was followed, in order to identify studies that sought to determine which outcomes/domains to measure in clinical trials of a specific condition. Additionally, a pop up survey was added to the COMET website, to ascertain why people were searching the COMET database.



Results
Thirty-two reports relating to 29 studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. There has been an improvement in the description of the scope of a COS and an increase in the proportion of studies using literature/systematic reviews and the Delphi technique. Clinical experts continue to be the most common group involved in developing COS, however patient and public involvement has increased. The pop-up survey revealed the most common reasons for visiting the COMET website to be thinking about developing a COS and planning a clinical trial.



Conclusions
This update demonstrates that recent studies appear to have adopted a more structured approach towards COS development and public representation has increased. However, there remains a need for developers to adequately describe details about the scope of COS, and for greater public engagement. The COMET database appears to be a useful resource for both COS developers and users of COS.",14,"['should be measured', 'was followed', 'was added']",3,3,0.21428571428571427,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146444,Choosing Important Health Outcomes for Comparative Effectiveness Research: An Updated Review and User Survey

Background
A country’s ability to become a prominent knowledge economy is tied closely to its ability to acquire skilled people who can compete internationally while resolving challenges of the future. To equip students with competence that can only by gained by being immersed in a foreign environment, outbound mobility is vital.



Methods
To analyze outbound student mobility in Taiwan using time series methods, this study aims to propose a hybrid approach FSDESVR which combines feature selection (FS) and support vector regression (SVR) with differential evolution (DE). FS and a DE algorithm were used for selecting reliable input features and determining the optimal initial parameters of SVR, respectively, to achieve high forecast accuracy.



Results
The proposed approach was examined using a dataset of outbound Taiwanese student mobility to ten countries between 1998 and 2018. Without the requirements of any special conditions for the proprieties of the objective function and constraints, the FSDESVR model retained the advantage of FS, SVR, and DE. A comparison of the FSDESVR model and other forecasting models revealed that FSDESVR provided the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) results for all the analyzed nations. The experimental results indicate that FSDESVR achieved higher forecasting accuracy than the compared models from the literature.



Conclusion
With the recognition of outbound values, key findings of Taiwanese outbound student mobility, and accurate application of the FSDESVR model, education administration units are exposed to a more in-depth view of future student mobility, which enables the implement of a more accurate education curriculum.",8,"['is tied', 'being immersed', 'were used', 'was examined', 'are exposed']",5,5,0.625,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0238129,Forecasting outbound student mobility: A machine learning approach
"Abstract

Background
A critical aspect of executive control is the ability to limit the adverse effects of interference. Previous studies have shown activation of left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex after the onset of interference, suggesting that interference may be resolved in a reactive manner. However, we suggest that interference control may also operate in a proactive manner to prevent effects of interference. The current study investigated the temporal dynamics of interference control by varying two factors – interference expectancy and fluid intelligence (gF) – that could influence whether interference control operates proactively versus reactively.



Methodology/Principal Findings
A modified version of the recent negatives task was utilized. Interference expectancy was manipulated across task blocks by changing the proportion of recent negative (interference) trials versus recent positive (facilitation) trials. Furthermore, we explored whether gF affected the tendency to utilize specific interference control mechanisms. When interference expectancy was low, activity in lateral prefrontal cortex replicated prior results showing a reactive control pattern (i.e., interference-sensitivity during probe period). In contrast, when interference expectancy was high, bilateral prefrontal cortex activation was more indicative of proactive control mechanisms (interference-related effects prior to the probe period). Additional results suggested that the proactive control pattern was more evident in high gF individuals, whereas the reactive control pattern was more evident in low gF individuals.



Conclusions/Significance
The results suggest the presence of two neural mechanisms of interference control, with the differential expression of these mechanisms modulated by both experimental (e.g., expectancy effects) and individual difference (e.g., gF) factors.",12,"['may be resolved', 'was utilized', 'was manipulated']",3,3,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012861,Neural Mechanisms of Interference Control in Working Memory: Effects of Interference Expectancy and Fluid Intelligence
"Abstract

Background
A crucial question for understanding sentence comprehension is the openness of syntactic and semantic processes for other sources of information. Using event-related potentials in a dual task paradigm, we had previously found that sentence processing takes into consideration task relevant sentence-external semantic but not syntactic information. In that study, internal and external information both varied within the same linguistic domain—either semantic or syntactic. Here we investigated whether across-domain sentence-external information would impact within-sentence processing.



Methodology
In one condition, adjectives within visually presented sentences of the structure [Det]-[Noun]-[Adjective]-[Verb] were semantically correct or incorrect. Simultaneously with the noun, auditory adjectives were presented that morphosyntactically matched or mismatched the visual adjectives with respect to gender.



Findings
As expected, semantic violations within the sentence elicited N400 and P600 components in the ERP. However, these components were not modulated by syntactic matching of the sentence-external auditory adjective. In a second condition, syntactic within-sentence correctness-variations were combined with semantic matching variations between the auditory and the visual adjective. Here, syntactic within-sentence violations elicited a LAN and a P600 that did not interact with semantic matching of the auditory adjective. However, semantic mismatching of the latter elicited a frontocentral positivity, presumably related to an increase in discourse level complexity.



Conclusion
The current findings underscore the open versus algorithmic nature of semantic and syntactic processing, respectively, during sentence comprehension.",11,"['were presented', 'were not modulated', 'were combined']",3,3,0.2727272727272727,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009742,How Is Sentence Processing Affected by External Semantic and Syntactic Information?

We searched the PubMed Database from March 12 to April 12, 2020 and identified 559 publications in the New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association, and The Lancet which were divided into COVID-19 (cases, n = 204) and nonCOVID-19 (controls, n = 355) associated content. After exclusion of secondary, unauthored, response letters and non-matching article types, 155 COVID-19 publications (including 13 original articles) and 130 nonCOVID-19 publications (including 52 original articles) were included in the comparative analysis. The hierarchical level of evidence was determined for each publication included and compared between cases and controls as the main outcome. A quantitative scoring of quality was carried out for the subgroup of original articles. The numbers of authors and citation rates were also compared between groups.



Results
The 130 nonCOVID-19 publications were associated with higher levels of evidence on the level of evidence pyramid, with a strong association measure (Cramer’s V: 0.452, P <0.001). The 155 COVID-19 publications were 186-fold more likely to be of lower evidence (95% confidence interval [CI] for odds ratio, 7.0–47; P <0.001). The quantitative quality score (maximum possible score, 28) was significantly different in favor of nonCOVID-19 (mean difference, 11.1; 95% CI, 8.5–13.7; P <0.001). There was a significant difference in the early citation rate of the original articles that favored the COVID-19 original articles (median [interquartile range], 45 [30–244] vs. 2 [1–4] citations; P <0.001).



Conclusions
We conclude that the quality of COVID-19 publications in the three highest ranked scientific medical journals is below the quality average of these journals. These findings need to be verified at a later stage of the pandemic.",16,"['were divided', 'were included', 'was determined', 'was carried', 'were also compared', 'be verified']",6,6,0.375,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0241826,Scientific quality of COVID-19 and SARS CoV-2 publications in the highest impact medical journals during the early phase of the pandemic: A case control study
"Abstract

Background
A disturbed self-image is central to the characteristic symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Evaluations of self-relevance (SR) are highly important in cognitive and emotional processing of information and adaptive behavior.



Method
In the current study, we used affective statements to investigate if SR is altered in patients with higher scores on Borderline Symptom List (BSL-95). Forthyfemale adults with BPD and 20 healthy participants assessed a set of stimuli consisting of sentences in third-person for relevance to self.



Results
BPD patients exhibited a higher SR for negative contents as compared to healthy controls (p < .001). Furthermore, a significant positive correlation coefficient was found between the increased bias in evaluating the SR of stimuli and borderline symptom severity scores, as measured by BSL-95 questionnaire (r = 0.67, p < .001). This effect persisted after controlling for depressive symptoms by a partial correlation analysis.



Conclusion
Our results revealed an enhanced SR for negative statements, which was related to the severity of individuals’ BPD symptoms. These findings add to the diagnostic information regarding the disturbed organization of self in this clinical population. We suggest the maladaptive evaluation of SR offers an important treatment target for therapeutic approaches to BPD.",10,"['is altered', 'was found', 'measured by bsl-95 questionnaire', 'was related']",4,3,0.3,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0209989,Effect of negative valence on assessment of self-relevance in female patients with borderline personality disorder
"Abstract

Background
A diverse research workforce is essential for catalyzing biomedical advancements, but this workforce goal is hindered by persistent sex and racial/ethnic disparities among investigators receiving research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In response, the NIH-funded National Research Mentoring Network implemented a Grant Writing Coaching Program (GCP) to provide diverse cohorts of early-career investigators across the United States with intensive coaching throughout the proposal development process. We evaluated the GCP’s national reach and short-term impact on participants’ proposal submissions and funding outcomes.



Methods
The GCP was delivered as six similar but distinct models. All models began with an in-person group session, followed by a series of coaching sessions over 4 to 12 months. Participants were surveyed at 6-, 12- and 18-months after program completion to assess proposal outcomes (submissions, awards). Self-reported data were verified and supplemented by searches of public repositories of awarded grants when available. Submission and award rates were derived from counts of participants who submitted or were awarded at least one grant proposal in a category (NIH, other federal, non-federal).



Results
From June 2015 through March 2019, 545 investigators (67% female, 61% under-represented racial/ethnic minority, URM) from 187 different institutions participated in the GCP. Among them, 324 (59% of participants) submitted at least one grant application and 134 (41% of submitters) received funding. A total of 164 grants were awarded, the majority being from the NIH (93, 56%). Of the 74 R01 (or similar) NIH research proposals submitted by GCP participants, 16 have been funded thus far (56% to URM, 75% to women). This 22% award rate exceeded the 2016–2018 NIH success rates for new R01s.



Conclusion
Inter- and intra-institutional grant writing coaching groups are a feasible and effective approach to supporting the grant acquisition efforts of early-career biomedical investigators, including women and those from URM groups.",14,"['is hindered', 'was delivered', 'followed by a series of coaching sessions over 4 to 12 months', 'were surveyed', 'were verified and supplemented by', 'were derived', 'were awarded', 'were awarded', 'have been funded']",9,8,0.5714285714285714,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0241851,Grant application outcomes for biomedical researchers who participated in the National Research Mentoring Network’s Grant Writing Coaching Programs
"Abstract

Background
A few meta-analyses have examined psychological treatments for a social anxiety disorder (SAD). This is the first meta-analysis that examines the effects of cognitive behavioural group therapies (CBGT) for SAD compared to control on symptoms of anxiety.



Method
After a systematic literature search in PubMed, Cochrane, PsychINFO and Embase was conducted; eleven studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. The studies had to be randomized controlled studies in which individuals with a diagnosed SAD were treated with cognitive-behavioural group therapy (CBGT) and compared with a control group. The overall quality of the studies was moderate.



Results
The pooled effect size indicated that the difference between intervention and control conditions was 0.53 (96% CI: 0.33–0.73), in favour of the intervention. This corresponds to a NNT 3.24. Heterogeneity was low to moderately high in all analyses. There was some indication of publication bias.



Conclusions
It was found that psychological group-treatments CBGT are more effective than control conditions in patients with SAD. Since heterogeneity between studies was high, more research comparing group psychotherapies for SAD to control is needed.",12,"['was conducted', 'were identified', 'be randomized', 'were treated', 'was found', 'is needed']",6,4,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079034,Psychological Group-Treatments of Social Anxiety Disorder: A Meta-Analysis
"Abstract

Background
A functional discrepancy exists in adolescents between frontal and subcortical regions due to differential regional maturational trajectories. It remains unknown how this functional discrepancy alters and whether the influence from the subcortical to the frontal system plays a primacy role in medication naïve adolescent with major depressive disorder (MDD).



Methodology/Principal Findings
Eighteen MDD and 18 healthy adolescents were enrolled. Depression and anxiety severity was assessed by the Short Mood and Feeling Questionnaire (SMFQ) and Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) respectively. The functional discrepancy was measured by the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of resting-state functional MRI signal. Correlation analysis was carried out between ALFF values and SMFQ and SCARED scores. Resting brain activity levels measured by ALFF was higher in the frontal cortex than that in the subcortical system involving mainly (para) limbic-striatal regions in both HC and MDD adolescents. The difference of ALFF values between frontal and subcortical systems was increased in MDD adolescents as compared with the controls.



Conclusions/Significance
The present study identified an increased imbalance of resting-state brain activity between the frontal cognitive control system and the (para) limbic-striatal emotional processing system in MDD adolescents. The findings may provide insights into the neural correlates of adolescent MDD.",10,"['were enrolled', 'was assessed', 'was measured', 'was carried', 'was increased']",5,5,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0025159,Increased Activity Imbalance in Fronto-Subcortical Circuits in Adolescents with Major Depression
"Abstract

Background
A fundamental aspect of epidemiological studies concerns the estimation of factor-outcome associations to identify risk factors, prognostic factors and potential causal factors. Because reliable estimates for these associations are important, there is a growing interest in methods for combining the results from multiple studies in individual participant data meta-analyses (IPD-MA). When there is substantial heterogeneity across studies, various random-effects meta-analysis models are possible that employ a one-stage or two-stage method. These are generally thought to produce similar results, but empirical comparisons are few.



Objective
We describe and compare several one- and two-stage random-effects IPD-MA methods for estimating factor-outcome associations from multiple risk-factor or predictor finding studies with a binary outcome. One-stage methods use the IPD of each study and meta-analyse using the exact binomial distribution, whereas two-stage methods reduce evidence to the aggregated level (e.g. odds ratios) and then meta-analyse assuming approximate normality. We compare the methods in an empirical dataset for unadjusted and adjusted risk-factor estimates.



Results
Though often similar, on occasion the one-stage and two-stage methods provide different parameter estimates and different conclusions. For example, the effect of erythema and its statistical significance was different for a one-stage (OR = 1.35, ) and univariate two-stage (OR = 1.55, ). Estimation issues can also arise: two-stage models suffer unstable estimates when zero cell counts occur and one-stage models do not always converge.



Conclusion
When planning an IPD-MA, the choice and implementation (e.g. univariate or multivariate) of a one-stage or two-stage method should be prespecified in the protocol as occasionally they lead to different conclusions about which factors are associated with outcome. Though both approaches can suffer from estimation challenges, we recommend employing the one-stage method, as it uses a more exact statistical approach and accounts for parameter correlation.",13,"['are generally thought', 'should be prespecified']",2,2,0.15384615384615385,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0060650,Individual Participant Data Meta-Analysis for a Binary Outcome: One-Stage or Two-Stage?
"Abstract

Background
A gender-based disparity in physical activity (PA) among youth, whereby girls are less active than boys is a persistent finding in the literature. A greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying this difference has potential to guide PA intervention strategies.



Methods
Data were collected at age 8 and 12 years (276 boys, 279 girls) from 29 schools as part of the LOOK study. Multilevel linear models were fitted separately for boys and girls to examine effects of individual, family and environmental level correlates on pedometer measured PA. Cardio-respiratory fitness (multi-stage run), percent fat (DEXA), eye-hand coordination (throw and catch test) and perceived competence in physical education (questionnaire) were used as individual level correlates. At the family level, parent’s support and education (questionnaire) were used. School attended and extracurricular sport participation were included as environmental level correlates.



Results
Girls were 19% less active than boys (9420 vs 11360 steps/day, p<0.001, 95%CI [1844, 2626]). Lower PA among girls was associated with weaker influences at the school and family levels and through lower participation in extracurricular sport. School attended explained some of the variation in boys PA (8.4%) but not girls. Girls compared to boys had less favourable individual attributes associated with PA at age 8 years, including 18% lower cardio-respiratory fitness (3.5 vs 4.2, p<0.001, CI [0.5,0.9]), 44% lower eye-hand coordination (11.0 vs 17.3, p<0.001, CI [5.1,9.0]), higher percent body fat (28% vs 23%, p<0.001, CI [3.5,5.7]) and 9% lower perceived competence in physical education (7.7 vs 8.4, p<0.001, CI [0.2,0.9]). Participation in extracurricular sport at either age 8 or 12 years was protective against declines in PA over time among boys but not girls.



Conclusion
Girls PA was less favourably influenced by socio-ecological factors at the individual, family, school and environmental levels. These factors are potentially modifiable suggesting the gap in PA between boys and girls can be reduced. Strategies aiming to increase PA should be multicomponent and take into consideration that pathways to increasing PA are likely to differ among boys and girls.",17,"['were collected', 'were fitted', 'were used', 'were used', 'were included', 'can be reduced']",6,6,0.35294117647058826,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150041,Why Are Girls Less Physically Active than Boys?

"Abstract

Background
A growing body of empirical evidence indicates that low-level social capital is related to poor mental health outcomes. However, the prospective association between social capital and depression remains unclear, and no published studies have investigated the association with longitudinal data in East-Asian countries.



Methods
We analyzed data from the ongoing Korean Welfare Panel Study to prospectively investigate association between social capital and depression. Social capital was measured at the individual level by two items specific to interpersonal trust and reciprocity. Depression was annually assessed as a dichotomous variable using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. After excluding participants who had depression in 2006, logistic regression models were applied to estimate the association between each social capital indicator and new-onset depression developed in 2007 or long-term depression in both 2007 and 2008. We also examined the association in a subpopulation restricted to healthy participants after excluding individuals with any pre-existing disability, chronic disease, or poor self-rated health condition.



Results
Compared to the high interpersonal trust group, the odds ratios of developing new-onset and long-term depression among the low interpersonal trust group were 1.22 (95% CI: 1.08∼1.38) and 1.23 (95% CI: 1.03∼1.50), respectively, and increased to 1.32 (95% CI: 1.10∼1.57) and 1.47 (95% CI: 1.05∼2.08) in the subpopulation analyses restricted to healthy individuals. Although the low and intermediate reciprocity group also had significantly higher odds of developing new-onset depression compared to the high reciprocity group, the effects were attenuated and statistically non-significant in the subpopulation analyses.



Conclusion
Low interpersonal trust appears to be an independent risk factor for new-onset and long-term depression in South Korea.",10,"['is related', 'was measured', 'was annually assessed', 'were applied', 'were attenuated']",5,5,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0030602,"Association between Interpersonal Trust, Reciprocity, and Depression in South Korea: A Prospective Analysis"
"Abstract

Background
A growing body of evidence points to relationships between insomnia, negative affect, and paranoid thinking. However, studies are needed to examine (i) whether negative affect mediates the relation between insomnia and paranoid thinking, (ii) whether different types of insomnia exert different effects on paranoia, and (iii) to compare the impact of objective and self-reported sleeping difficulties.



Method
Structural equation modelling was therefore used to test competing models of the relationships between self-reported insomnia, negative affect, and paranoia. n = 348 participants completed measures of insomnia, negative affect and paranoia. A subset of these participants (n = 91) went on to monitor their sleep objectively (using a portable sleep monitor made by Zeo) for seven consecutive nights. Associations between objectively recorded sleep, negative affect, and paranoia were explored using linear regression.



Results
The findings supported a fully mediated model where self-reported delayed sleep onset, but not self-reported problems with sleep maintenance or objective measures of sleep, was directly associated with negative affect that, in turn, was associated with paranoia. There was no evidence of a direct association between delayed sleep onset or sleep maintenance problems and paranoia.



Conclusions
Taken together, the findings point to an association between perceived (but not objective) difficulties initially falling asleep (but not maintaining sleep) and paranoid thinking; a relationship that is fully mediated by negative affect. Future research should seek to disentangle the causal relationships between sleep, negative affect, and paranoia (e.g., by examining the effect of an intervention using prospective designs that incorporate experience sampling). Indeed, interventions might profitably target (i) perceived sleep quality, (ii) sleep onset, and / or (iii) emotion regulation as a route to reducing negative affect and, thus, paranoid thinking.",11,"['are needed', 'was therefore used', 'were explored', 'is fully mediated']",4,4,0.36363636363636365,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0186233,"A structural equation model of the relationship between insomnia, negative affect, and paranoid thinking"
"Abstract

Background
A growing body of evidence suggests that meditative training enhances perception and cognition. In Japan, the Park-Sasaki method of speed-reading involves organized visual training while forming both a relaxed and concentrated state of mind, as in meditation. The present study examined relationships between reading speed, sentence comprehension, and eye movements while reading short Japanese novels. In addition to normal untrained readers, three middle-level trainees and one high-level expert on this method were included for the two case studies.



Methodology/Principal Findings
In Study 1, three of 17 participants were middle-level trainees on the speed-reading method. Immediately after reading each story once on a computer monitor, participants answered true or false questions regarding the content of the novel. Eye movements while reading were recorded using an eye-tracking system. Results revealed higher reading speed and lower comprehension scores in the trainees than in the untrained participants. Furthermore, eye-tracking data by untrained participants revealed multiple correlations between reading speed, accuracy and eye-movement measures, with faster readers showing shorter fixation durations and larger saccades in X than slower readers. In Study 2, participants included a high-level expert and 14 untrained students. The expert showed higher reading speed and statistically comparable, although numerically lower, comprehension scores compared with the untrained participants. During test sessions this expert moved her eyes along a nearly straight horizontal line as a first pass, without moving her eyes over the whole sentence display as did the untrained students.



Conclusions/Significance
In addition to revealing correlations between speed, comprehension and eye movements in reading Japanese contemporary novels by untrained readers, we describe cases of speed-reading trainees regarding relationships between these variables. The trainees overall tended to show poor performance influenced by the speed-accuracy trade-off, although this trade-off may be reduced in the case of at least one high-level expert.",15,"['were included', 'were recorded', 'may be reduced']",3,3,0.2,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036091,"Reading Speed, Comprehension and Eye Movements While Reading Japanese Novels: Evidence from Untrained Readers and Cases of Speed-Reading Trainees"

Background
A growing body of research indicates that cross-cultural competence in nurses can improve migrant patients’ health-related outcomes, but little is known about the potential benefits of cross-cultural competence on the nurses’ own well-being.



Objective
To examine whether cross-cultural competence (empathy, skills, positive attitudes, and motivation) is associated with perceived time pressure at work, psychological distress, and sleep problems among registered nurses in Finland, and whether there are differences in these potential associations between native and foreign-born nurses.



Methods
The present cross-sectional study was based on a sample of 212 foreign-born nurses licensed to practice in Finland and a random sample of 744 native Finnish nurses. Data were collected with a questionnaire and analyzed using multiple linear regression and structural equation modeling (SEM).



Results
Of all four dimensions of cross-cultural competence, only empathy was associated with perceived time pressure (β = –0.13, p = .018), distress (β = –0.23, p < .001), and sleep problems (β = –0.14, p = .004) after the adjustment for gender, age, employment sector, and frequency of interacting with patients and colleagues from different cultures. There were no differences between native and foreign-born nurses in these observed associations (all ps > .05).



Conclusions
Cross-cultural empathy may protect against perceived time pressure, distress, and sleep problems in both native and foreign-born nurses. Thus, the promotion of this component of cross-cultural competence among nursing personnel should be encouraged.",8,"['is known', 'were collected', 'should be encouraged']",3,3,0.375,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208761,The association between cross-cultural competence and well-being among registered native and foreign-born nurses in Finland

Background
A growing literature explores spatial patterns of regional and neighborhood correlates of sexual minority (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual) concentration. Such patterns have implications for health and wellbeing if there are differences in health-promoting or health-hindering resources in neighborhoods or regions. We conducted a systematic review to assess sexual minority concentration in relation to area unit characteristics.



Methods
We included only records published after 1973 and made no exclusions by geography or language. We searched 11 databases (Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, Embase, GeoBase, GeoRef, LGBT Life, PsycINFO, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science) on November 19–21, 2016. We searched reference lists of included records. We used the following inclusion criteria: (1) Record is a quantitative study (that is, it uses statistics to describe or associate two or more variables); (2) Record is about (a) migration or internal migration of, (b) area unit selection by, or (c) concentration of sexual minority people (defined by identity, behavior, or attraction); (3) Criterion 2 is linked to the characteristics of regions or neighborhoods (at any spatial scale).



Results
Dual independent coding resulted in 51 records meeting inclusion criteria from the original pool of 5,591. From these records, we identified the 647 reported results linking sexual minority concentration with area unit characteristics. Of these, 132 were unadjusted relationships between sexual minority concentration and four theory-informed domains of neighborhood influence on health. We identified greater concentration of sexual minorities in regions with more resources and in more urban regions. A limited but troubling literature at the neighborhood level suggested potentially higher concentrations of sexual minorities in neighborhoods with fewer resources.



Conclusions
There are substantial gaps in the literature. We discuss the implications of our findings and gaps in relation to key theories of sexual minority health.

Background
A growing number of studies have sought to examine the health associations of workplace social capital; however, evidence of associations with overweight is sparse. We examined the association between individual perceptions of workplace social capital and overweight among Japanese male and female employees.



Methodology/Principal Findings
We conducted a cross-sectional survey among full-time employees at a company in Osaka prefecture in February 2012. We used an 8-item measure to assess overall and sub-dimensions of workplace social capital, divided into tertiles. Of 1050 employees, 849 responded, and 750 (624 men and 126 women) could be linked to annual health check-up data in the analysis. Binomial logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for overweight (body mass index: ≥25 kg/m2, calculated from measured weight and height) separately for men and women. The prevalence of overweight was 24.5% among men and 14.3% among women. Among men, low levels of bonding and linking social capital in the workplace were associated with a nearly 2-fold risk of overweight compared to high corresponding dimensions of social capital when adjusted for age, sleep hours, physiological distress, and lifestyle. In contrast, among women we found lower overall and linking social capital to be associated with lower odds for overweight even after covariate adjustment. Subsequently, we used multinomial logistic regression analyses to assess the relationships between a 1 standard deviation (SD) decrease in mean social capital and odds of underweight/overweight relative to normal weight. Among men, a 1-SD decrease in overall, bonding, and linking social capital was significantly associated with higher odds of overweight, but not with underweight. Among women, no significant associations were found for either overweight or underweight.



Conclusions/Significance
We found opposite gender relationships between perceived low linking workplace social capital and overweight among Japanese employees.",12,"['could be linked', 'were used', 'were found']",3,3,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088084,The Bright Side and Dark Side of Workplace Social Capital: Opposing Effects of Gender on Overweight among Japanese Employees
"Abstract

Background
A healthy diet is important for normal growth and development. Exposure to undernutrition during important developmental periods such as childhood and adolescence can have effects later in life. Inhabitants of the west of the Netherlands were exposed to severe undernutrition during the famine in the last winter of the second World War (1944–1945).



Objective
We investigated if exposure of women to the Dutch famine during childhood and adolescence was associated with an unhealthy lifestyle later in life.



Design
We studied 7,525 women from the Prospect-EPIC cohort, recruited in 1993–97 and aged 0–18 years during the Dutch famine. An individual famine score was calculated based on self-reported information about experience of hunger and weight loss. We investigated the association between famine exposure in early life and four lifestyle factors in adulthood: smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity level and a Mediterranean-style diet.



Results
Of the 7,525 included women, 46% were unexposed, 38% moderately exposed and 16% severely exposed to the Dutch famine. Moderately and severely exposed women were more often former or current smokers compared to women that did not suffer from the famine: adjusted prevalence ratio 1.10 (95% CI: 1.05; 1.14) and 1.18 (1.12; 1.25), respectively. They also smoked more pack years than unexposed women. Severely exposed women were more often physically inactive than unexposed women, adjusted prevalence ratio 1.32 (1.06; 1.64). Results did not differ between exposure age categories (0–9 and 10–17 years). We found no associations of famine exposure with alcohol consumption and no dose-dependent relations with diet.



Conclusions
Exposure to famine early in female life may be associated with higher prevalence of smoking and physical inactivity later in life, but not with unhealthy diet and alcohol consumption.",14,"['were exposed', 'was calculated']",2,2,0.14285714285714285,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0156609,Exposure to Famine at a Young Age and Unhealthy Lifestyle Behavior Later in Life
"Abstract

Background
A hierarchy, characterized by tree-like relationships, is a natural method of organizing data in various domains. When considering an unsupervised machine learning routine, such as clustering, a bottom-up hierarchical (BU, agglomerative) algorithm is used as a default and is often the only method applied.



Methodology/Principal Findings
We show that hierarchical clustering that involve global considerations, such as top-down (TD, divisive), or glocal (global-local) algorithms are better suited to reveal meaningful patterns in the data. This is demonstrated, by testing the correspondence between the results of several algorithms (TD, glocal and BU) and the correct annotations provided by experts. The correspondence was tested in multiple domains including gene expression experiments, stock trade records and functional protein families. The performance of each of the algorithms is evaluated by statistical criteria that are assigned to clusters (nodes of the hierarchy tree) based on expert-labeled data. Whereas TD algorithms perform better on global patterns, BU algorithms perform well and are advantageous when finer granularity of the data is sought. In addition, a novel TD algorithm that is based on genuine density of the data points is presented and is shown to outperform other divisive and agglomerative methods. Application of the algorithm to more than 500 protein sequences belonging to ion-channels illustrates the potential of the method for inferring overlooked functional annotations. ClustTree, a graphical Matlab toolbox for applying various hierarchical clustering algorithms and testing their quality is made available.



Conclusions
Although currently rarely used, global approaches, in particular, TD or glocal algorithms, should be considered in the exploratory process of clustering. In general, applying unsupervised clustering methods can leverage the quality of manually-created mapping of proteins families. As demonstrated, it can also provide insights in erroneous and missed annotations.",14,"['is used', 'is demonstrated', 'was tested', 'is evaluated', 'are assigned', 'is sought', 'is presented', 'is shown', 'is made', 'should be considered']",10,8,0.5714285714285714,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002247,Global Considerations in Hierarchical Clustering Reveal Meaningful Patterns in Data
"Abstract

Background
A history of early adverse experiences is an important risk factor for adult psychopathology. Changes in stress sensitivity and functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may underlie the association between stress and risk for psychiatric disorders. Preclinical work in rodents has linked low levels of maternal care to increased methylation of the promoter region of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene, as well as to exaggerated hormonal and behavioral responses to stress. Recent studies have begun to examine whether early-life stress leads to epigenetic modifications of the GR gene in humans.



Methods
We examined the degree of methylation of a region of the promoter of the human GR gene (NR3C1) in leukocyte DNA from 99 healthy adults. Participants reported on their childhood experiences of parental behavior, parental death or desertion, and childhood maltreatment. On a separate day, participants completed the dexamethasone/corticotropin-releasing hormone (Dex/CRH) test, a standardized neuroendocrine challenge test.



Results
Disruption or lack of adequate nurturing, as measured by parental loss, childhood maltreatment, and parental care, was associated with increased NR3C1 promoter methylation (p<.05). In addition, NR3C1 promoter methylation was linked to attenuated cortisol responses to the Dex/CRH test (p<.05).



Conclusions
These findings suggest that childhood maltreatment or adversity may lead to epigenetic modifications of the human GR gene. Alterations in methylation of this gene could underlie the associations between childhood adversity, alterations in stress reactivity, and risk for psychopathology.",11,"['measured by parental loss, childhood maltreatment, and parental care, was associated with increased nr3c1 promoter methylation', 'was linked']",2,2,0.18181818181818182,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0030148,Childhood Adversity and Epigenetic Modulation of the Leukocyte Glucocorticoid Receptor: Preliminary Findings in Healthy Adults

A key aspect of representations for object recognition and scene analysis in the ventral visual stream is the spatial frame of reference, be it a viewer-centered, object-centered, or scene-based coordinate system. Coordinate transforms from retinocentric space to other reference frames involve combining neural visual responses with extraretinal postural information.



Methodology/Principal Findings
We examined whether such spatial information is available to anterior inferotemporal (AIT) neurons in the macaque monkey by measuring the effect of eye position on responses to a set of simple 2D shapes. We report, for the first time, a significant eye position effect in over 40% of recorded neurons with small gaze angle shifts from central fixation. Although eye position modulates responses, it does not change shape selectivity.



Conclusions/Significance
These data demonstrate that spatial information is available in AIT for the representation of objects and scenes within a non-retinocentric frame of reference. More generally, the availability of spatial information in AIT calls into questions the classic dichotomy in visual processing that associates object shape processing with ventral structures such as AIT but places spatial processing in a separate anatomical stream projecting to dorsal structures.",7,[],0,0,0.0,0,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003492,Spatial Modulation of Primate Inferotemporal Responses by Eye Position

Background
A key mechanism thought to underlie Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is enhanced emotional memory consolidation. Recent evidence in healthy controls revealed that women have greater negative memory consolidation following stress relative to men. This study examined emotional memory consolidation in women and men with PTSD, and in trauma-exposed and non-trauma controls to test the hypothesis that emotionally negative memory consolidation would be greater in women with PTSD.



Method
One hundred and forty-seven men and women (47 with PTSD, 49 trauma-exposed controls, and 51 non-trauma controls) completed an emotional memory task where they looked at negative, neutral and positive images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Delayed recall and an intrusive memory diary were completed two days later.



Results
Women displayed greater recall, and reported more negative intrusive memories than men. A gender x group interaction effect showed that both women with PTSD and trauma-exposed women reported more intrusive memories than women without trauma exposure or men.



Conclusion
This study provided preliminary evidence of sex differences in intrusive memories in those with PTSD as well as those with a history of trauma exposure. Future research should include measures of sex hormones to further examine sex differences on memory consolidation in the context of trauma exposure and PTSD.",9,"['mechanism thought', 'is enhanced', 'were completed']",3,2,0.2222222222222222,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208575,Sex differences in intrusive memories following trauma

Background
A knowledge brokering (KB) intervention was implemented in Burkina Faso. By creating partnerships with health system actors in one district, the broker was expected to assess their knowledge needs, survey the literature to provide the most recent research evidence, produce various knowledge translation tools, and support them in using research to improve their actions. The purpose of this study was to analyze the key factors that influenced the KB project and to make recommendations for future initiatives.



Methods
The qualitative design involved a single case study in which the KB intervention implementation was evaluated retrospectively. Data came from interviews with the intervention team (n = 4) and with various actors involved in the intervention (n = 16). Data from formative evaluations conducted during the KB implementation and observation data from a two-month field mission were also used. Two conceptual frameworks were combined to guide the analysis: the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (Damschroder et al., 2009) and the Ecological Framework (Durlak & DuPre, 2008).



Results
Various KB activities were conducted during the first two years of implementation at the local level. The project came to an early end following vain efforts to relocate the intervention at the central level in order to further influence the policy process. Certain shortcomings in the implementation team negatively influenced the implementation: inadequate leadership, no shared vision regarding the reorientation of the intervention, challenges related to the KB role, and lack of frank communications internally. Other impediments to the intervention’s deployment included local actors' lack of decision-making authority, the unavailability of resources and of organizational incentives for involvement in the KB intervention, and contextual challenges in accessing the central level. However, the KB strategy presented several strengths: collaborative development, support provided to local partners by the broker, and training opportunities and support provided to the broker.



Conclusions
More attention must be paid to intervention planning, partners’ engagement, human, financial and technical resources availability, continuous development of skills and of communications within the KB team, and periodic assessment of potential obstacles related to the complexity of the system within which the intervention has been implemented. Using implementation science frameworks when developing KB strategies in the West African context should be promoted.",13,"['was implemented', 'was expected', 'was evaluated', 'were also used', 'were combined', 'were conducted', 'must be paid', 'has been implemented', 'should be promoted']",9,7,0.5384615384615384,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0220105,A health knowledge brokering intervention in a district of Burkina Faso: A qualitative retrospective implementation analysis

Background
A lack of balance between energy intake and expenditure due to overeating or reduced physical activity does not seem to explain entirely the obesity epidemic we are facing, and further factors are therefore being evaluated. Nickel (Ni) is a ubiquitous heavy metal implied in several health conditions. Regarding this, the European Food Safety Authority has recently released an alert on the possible deleterious effects of dietary Ni on human health given the current levels of Ni dietary intake in some countries. Pre-clinical studies have also suggested its role as an endocrine disruptor and have linked its exposure to energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis dysregulation. Ni allergy is common in the general population, but preliminary data suggest it being even more widespread among overweight patients.



Objectives
The aim of this study has been to evaluate the presence of Ni allergy and its association with the metabolic and endocrine profile in overweight and obese individuals.



Methods
We have evaluated 1128 consecutive overweight and obese outpatients. 784 were suspected of being allergic to Ni and 666 were assessed for it. Presence of Ni allergy and correlation with body mass index (BMI), body composition, metabolic parameters and hormonal levels were evaluated.



Results
We report that Ni allergy is more frequent in presence of weight excess and is associated with worse metabolic parameters and impaired Growth Hormone secretion.



Conclusions
We confirm that Ni allergy is more common in obese patients, and we report for the first time its association with worse metabolic parameters and impaired function of the GH-IGF1 axis in human subjects.",12,"['being evaluated', 'metal implied', 'were suspected', 'were assessed', 'were evaluated']",5,4,0.3333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202683,Overweight and obese patients with nickel allergy have a worse metabolic profile compared to weight matched non-allergic individuals

Background
A lack of evidence exists on the association between area-level income inequality and oral health within Australia. This study examined associations between area-level income inequality and oral health outcomes (inadequate dentition (<21 teeth) and poor self-rated oral health) among Australian adults. Variations in the association between area-level income inequality and oral health outcomes according to area-level mean income were also assessed. Finally, household-income gradients in oral health outcomes according to area-level income inequality were compared.



Methods
For the analyses, data on Australian dentate adults (n = 5,165 nested in 435 Local Government Areas (LGAs)) was obtained from the National Dental Telephone Interview Survey-2013. Multilevel multivariable logistic regression models with random intercept and fixed slopes were fitted to test associations between area-level income inequality and oral health outcomes, examine variations in associations according to area-level mean income, and examine variations in household-income gradients in outcomes according to area-level income inequality. Covariates included age, sex, LGA-level mean weekly household income, geographic remoteness and household income.



Results
LGA-level income inequality was not associated with poor self-rated oral health and inversely associated with inadequate dentition (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.87) after adjusting for covariates. Inverse association between income inequality and inadequate dentition at the individual level was limited to LGAs within the highest tertile of mean weekly household income. Household income gradients in both outcomes showed poorer oral health at lower levels of household income. The household income gradients for inadequate dentition varied according to the LGA-level income inequality.



Conclusion
Findings suggest that income inequality at the LGA-level in Australia is not positively associated with poorer oral health outcomes. Inverse association between income inequality and inadequate dentition is likely due to the contextual differences between Australia and other high-income countries.",13,"['were also assessed', 'were compared', '5,165 nested', 'was obtained', 'were fitted', 'was limited']",6,4,0.3076923076923077,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0191438,Area-level income inequality and oral health among Australian adults—A population-based multilevel study

Background
A large literature has indicated a robust association between birth spacing and child survival, but evidence on the association of birth timing with physical growth in low and middle income countries (LMICs) remains limited.



Methods and Results
Data from 153 cross-sectional Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) across 61 LMICs conducted between 1990 and 2011 were combined to assess the association of birth timing with child stunting (height-for-age z-score <−2). A total of 623,789 children of birth order 1–5 contributed to the maternal age analysis, while the birth spacing dataset consisted of 584,226 children of birth order 2 and higher. Compared to 27–34 year old mothers, maternal age under 18 years was associated with a relative stunting risk of 1.35 (95% CI: 1.29–1.40) for firstborn children, whereas the relative risk was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.19–1.29) for mothers aged 18–19 years. The association of young maternal age with stunting was significantly greater for urban residents and those in the top 50% of household wealth. Birth intervals less than 12 months and 12–23 months had relative risks for stunting of 1.09 (95% CI: 1.06–1.12) and 1.06 (95% CI: 1.05–1.06) as compared to a 24–35 month inter-pregnancy interval, respectively. The strength of both teenage pregnancy and short birth interval associations showed substantial variation across WHO region. We estimate that 8.6% (6.9–10.3%) of stunted cases in the South Asian DHS sample would have been averted by jointly eliminating teen pregnancies and birth intervals less than 24 months, while only 3.6% (1.5–5.7%) of stunting cases would have prevented in the Middle East and North Africa sample.



Conclusions
Postponing the age of first birth and increasing inter-pregnancy intervals has the potential to significantly reduce the prevalence of stunting and improve child development in LMICs.",8,"['were combined', 'would have been averted']",2,2,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0102391,Scaling-Up Access to Family Planning May Improve Linear Growth and Child Development in Low and Middle Income Countries

Background
A large number of men who have sex with men (MSM) and people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) are underserved despite increased service availability from government facilities while many community based organizations (CBOs) are not involved. We aimed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the task shifting from government facilities to CBOs in China.



Methods
HIV preventive intervention for MSM and follow-up care for PLHA were shifted from government facilities to CBOs. Based on ‘cash on service delivery’ model, 10 USD per MSM tested for HIV with results notified, 82 USD per newly HIV cases diagnosed, and 50 USD per PLHA received a defined package of follow-up care services, were paid to the CBOs. Cash payments were made biannually based on the verified results in the national web-based HIV/AIDS information system.



Findings
After task shifting, CBOs gradually assumed preventive intervention for MSM and follow-up care for PLHA from 2008 to 2012. HIV testing coverage among MSM increased from 4.1% in 2008 to 22.7% in 2012. The baseline median CD4 counts of newly diagnosed HIV positive MSM increased from 309 to 397 cells/µL. HIV tests among MSM by CBOs accounted for less than 1% of the total HIV tests in Nanjing but the share of HIV cases detected by CBOs was 12.4% in 2008 and 43.6% in 2012. Unit cost per HIV case detected by CBOs was 47 times lower than that by government facilities. The coverage of CD4 tests and antiretroviral therapy increased from 71.1% and 78.6% in 2008 to 86.0% and 90.1% in 2012, respectively.



Conclusion
It is feasible to shift essential HIV services from government facilities to CBOs, and to verify independently service results to adopt ‘cash on service delivery’ model. Services provided by CBOs are cost-effective, as compared with that by government facilities.",14,"['were shifted', 'were paid', 'were made']",3,3,0.21428571428571427,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0103146,The Increased Effectiveness of HIV Preventive Intervention among Men Who Have Sex with Men and of Follow-Up Care for People Living with HIV after ‘Task-Shifting’ to Community-Based Organizations: A ‘Cash on Service Delivery’ Model in China
"Abstract

Background
A large proportion of COPD patients do not achieve the recommended level of physical activity. It is suggested that feedback on the level of activity by using an activity monitoring device (PAM) increases awareness and may stimulate patients to increase their physical activity in daily life. Our objective was to assess the validity and usability of a simple and low-cost physical activity monitor (Polar A300™) when compared with the validated and established Bodymedia-SenseWear™ (SWA) device.



Methods
To assess the diagnostic equivalent, two different PAM devices were used in parallel in 20 COPD patients GOLD I to IV during 3 consecutive days of daily life. Both systems were compared in terms of steps, calories burned, daily activity time and metabolic equivalents using linear regression analysis and Bland-Altman plots. Practical usability was examined by a 16-item-questionnaire.



Results
High correlations of both devices were observed with regard to the sensed step count (r = 0.96; p < 0.01) and calories burned (r = 0.74; p < 0.01), and a lower correlation of daily activity (r = 0.25; p < 0.01) was found. Data analysis over 3 days showed that 90% of the steps (95% CI -4223 to 1887), 100% of the calories (95% CI -2798 to 1887), 90% of the daily activity data (95% CI -12.32, 4065) and 95% of the MET (95% CI -3.11 to 2.75) were within the limits of agreement. A favorable usability (system-, information- and interface quality) of the A300™ device was shown (p < 0.01).



Conclusion
The A300™ device with easy practical usability was shown not to be inferior for assessment of physical activity time, step count and calorie consumption in COPD patients when compared with the SWA. It is suggested to consider widespread available devices as commonly used for monitoring recreational sporting activities also in patients for assessment of physical activity in daily life.",11,"['is suggested', 'were used', 'were compared', 'was examined', 'were observed', 'was found', 'was shown', 'was shown', 'is suggested']",9,8,0.7272727272727273,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157229,Validity and Usability of Physical Activity Monitoring in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

Background
A large proportion of mindfulness-based therapy trials report statistically significant results, even in the context of very low statistical power. The objective of the present study was to characterize the reporting of “positive” results in randomized controlled trials of mindfulness-based therapy. We also assessed mindfulness-based therapy trial registrations for indications of possible reporting bias and reviewed recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses to determine whether reporting biases were identified.



Methods
CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, ISI, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and SCOPUS databases were searched for randomized controlled trials of mindfulness-based therapy. The number of positive trials was described and compared to the number that might be expected if mindfulness-based therapy were similarly effective compared to individual therapy for depression. Trial registries were searched for mindfulness-based therapy registrations. CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, ISI, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and SCOPUS were also searched for mindfulness-based therapy systematic reviews and meta-analyses.



Results
108 (87%) of 124 published trials reported ≥1 positive outcome in the abstract, and 109 (88%) concluded that mindfulness-based therapy was effective, 1.6 times greater than the expected number of positive trials based on effect size d = 0.55 (expected number positive trials = 65.7). Of 21 trial registrations, 13 (62%) remained unpublished 30 months post-trial completion. No trial registrations adequately specified a single primary outcome measure with time of assessment. None of 36 systematic reviews and meta-analyses concluded that effect estimates were overestimated due to reporting biases.



Conclusions
The proportion of mindfulness-based therapy trials with statistically significant results may overstate what would occur in practice.",11,"['were identified', 'were searched', 'was described and compared to', 'might be expected', 'were searched', 'were also searched', 'were overestimated']",7,6,0.5454545454545454,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153220,Reporting of Positive Results in Randomized Controlled Trials of Mindfulness-Based Mental Health Interventions

Background
A limited amount of research, primarily conducted in Western countries, has suggested that higher socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with higher risk of eating disorders (EDs). However, little is known about this association in Asian countries. We examined the association of SES with disturbed eating behavior (DEB) and related factors in Korean adolescents.



Subjects
A nationwide online panel survey was conducted in a sample of adolescents (n = 6,943, 49.9% girls). DEB was measured with the 26-item Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26). Participants who scored ≥20 on the EAT-26 were considered to have DEB. Participants’ SES was determined based on self-reported household economic status.



Results
The prevalence of DEB was 12.7%: 10.5% among boys and 14.8% among girls. Both boys and girls with DEB were more likely to perceive themselves as obese, experience higher levels of stress, and have lower academic achievement. The risk for DEB was significantly higher in boys of higher SES than in those of middle SES (OR = 1.45, 95%CI = 1.05–1.99 for high SES; OR = 5.16, 95%CI: 3.50–7.61 for highest SES). Among girls, higher risk of DEB was associated with the highest and lowest SES (OR = 1.52, 95%CI: 1.13–2.06 for lowest SES; OR = 2.22, 95%CI: 1.34–3.68 for highest SES).



Conclusions
Despite the lower prevalence of obesity in Korea compared with Western countries, the prevalence of DEB in Korean adolescents was high, especially among girls. Moreover, the association between SES and DEB followed a U-shaped curve for girls and a J-shaped curve for boys.",13,"['is known', 'was conducted', 'was measured', 'were considered', 'was determined']",5,5,0.38461538461538464,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0057880,The Association between Disturbed Eating Behavior and Socioeconomic Status: The Online Korean Adolescent Panel Survey (OnKAPS)

Background
A link between severe mental stress and shorter telomere length (TL) has been suggested. We analysed the impact of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) on TL in the general population and postulated a dose-dependent TL association in subjects suffering from partial PTSD compared to full PTSD.



Methods
Data are derived from the population-based KORA F4 study (2006–2008), located in southern Germany including 3,000 individuals (1,449 men and 1,551 women) with valid and complete TL data. Leukocyte TL was measured using a quantitative PCR-based technique. PTSD was assessed in a structured interview and by applying the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES). A total of 262 (8.7%) subjects qualified for having partial PTSD and 51 (1.7%) for full PTSD. To assess the association of PTSD with the average TL, linear regression analyses with adjustments for potential confounding factors were performed.



Results
The multiple model revealed a significant association between partial PTSD and TL (beta = −0.051, p = 0.009) as well as between full PTSD and shorter TL (beta = −0.103, p = 0.014) indicating shorter TL on average for partial and full PTSD. An additional adjustment for depression and depressed mood/exhaustion gave comparable beta estimations.



Conclusions
Participants with partial and full PTSD had significantly shorter leukocyte TL than participants without PTSD. The dose-dependent variation in TL of subjects with partial and full PTSD exceeded the chronological age effect, and was equivalent to an estimated 5 years in partial and 10 years in full PTSD of premature aging.",10,"['has been suggested', 'are derived', 'was measured', 'was assessed', 'were performed']",5,5,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064762,"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Not Depression Is Associated with Shorter Leukocyte Telomere Length: Findings from 3,000 Participants in the Population-Based KORA F4 Study"

Background
A low dietary diversity score (DDS) and low consumption of food from animal sources (ASF) are among the factors related to malnutrition in school-aged children living in Libo Kemkem and Fogera (Ethiopia).



Objectives
This study aimed to identify associated determinants for low dietary diversity and lack of consumption of ASF.



Methods
In 2009, a cross-sectional survey was carried out in May, at the end of the lean season. Socio-demographic characteristics and diet habits were collected from 886 school-aged children. Additionally, 516 children from rural sites were followed up in the post-harvest season, in December of the same year. Bivariate and multivariable statistical methods were employed to assess low DDS and ASF intake and their association with different factors.



Results
Up to 80% and 60% of school-aged children living in rural and urban sites, respectively, ate ≤ 3 food groups the day before the survey. The percentage of children consuming ASF was significantly higher in urban settings (64% vs 18%). In the rural areas, if the head of the household was male (OR: 1.91; 95%CI: 1.00-3.65) and older than 40 years (OR: 1.56; 95%CI: 1.02-2.38) the child had a lower DDS in the lean season, while differences by socioeconomic indexes were observed in the post-harvest season. Males took more ASF than females in rural settings (OR: 1.73; 95%CI: 1.14-2.62) and differences by socioeconomic indexes were observed in both settings in the lean season, though not in post-harvest survey.



Conclusions
The findings of this study revealed that the diet among school-aged children in Libo Kemkem and Fogera districts lacked diversity, and that the intake of foods from animal sources was low, especially among rural girls. To effectively tackle malnutrition, dietary diversification strategies oriented to the local needs are recommended.",12,"['was carried', 'were collected', 'were followed', 'were employed', 'were observed', 'were observed', 'strategies oriented', 'are recommended']",8,7,0.5833333333333334,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133435,"Low Dietary Diversity and Intake of Animal Source Foods among School Aged Children in Libo Kemkem and Fogera Districts, Ethiopia"

Background
A major barrier to improving perinatal mental health in Africa is the lack of locally validated tools for identifying probable cases of perinatal depression or for measuring changes in depression symptom severity. We systematically reviewed the evidence on the reliability and validity of instruments to assess perinatal depression in African settings.



Methods and Findings
Of 1,027 records identified through searching 7 electronic databases, we reviewed 126 full-text reports. We included 25 unique studies, which were disseminated in 26 journal articles and 1 doctoral dissertation. These enrolled 12,544 women living in nine different North and sub-Saharan African countries. Only three studies (12%) used instruments developed specifically for use in a given cultural setting. Most studies provided evidence of criterion-related validity (20 [80%]) or reliability (15 [60%]), while fewer studies provided evidence of construct validity, content validity, or internal structure. The Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS), assessed in 16 studies (64%), was the most frequently used instrument in our sample. Ten studies estimated the internal consistency of the EPDS (median estimated coefficient alpha, 0.84; interquartile range, 0.71-0.87). For the 14 studies that estimated sensitivity and specificity for the EPDS, we constructed 2 x 2 tables for each cut-off score. Using a bivariate random-effects model, we estimated a pooled sensitivity of 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-0.99) and a pooled specificity of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.59-0.88) at a cut-off score of ≥9, with higher cut-off scores yielding greater specificity at the cost of lower sensitivity. 



Conclusions
The EPDS can reliably and validly measure perinatal depression symptom severity or screen for probable postnatal depression in African countries, but more validation studies on other instruments are needed. In addition, more qualitative research is needed to adequately characterize local understandings of perinatal depression-like syndromes in different African contexts.",12,"['were disseminated', 'are needed', 'is needed']",3,3,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082521,Reliability and Validity of Instruments for Assessing Perinatal Depression in African Settings: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
"Abstract

Background
A major challenge of mental health care is to provide safe and effective treatment with limited resources. The main purpose of this study was to examine a value-based approach in clinical psychiatry when evaluating a process improvement initiative. This was accomplished by using the relatively new time driven activity based costing (TDABC) method within the more widely adopted cost-effectiveness analysis framework for economic evaluation of healthcare technologies. The objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of allowing psychologists to perform post-treatment assessment previously performed by psychiatrists at an outpatient clinic treating depression using internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT).



Methods
Data was collected from 568 adult patients treated with ICBT for depression during 2013–2014. The TDABC methodology was used to estimate total healthcare costs, including development of process maps for the complete cycle of care and estimation of resource use and minute costs of staff, hospital space and materials based on their relative proportions used. Clinical outcomes were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-9) before and after treatment and at 6-month follow-up. Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) was performed and the results presented as incremental net benefits (INB), cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) and confidence ellipses to demonstrate uncertainty around the value of the organizational intervention.



Outcomes
Taking into account the complete healthcare process (from referral to follow-up assessment), treatment costs decreased from $709 (SD = $130) per patient in 2013 to $659 (SD = $134) in 2014 while treatment effectiveness was maintained; 27% had achieved full remission from depression after treatment (PHQ-9 < 5) during both 2013 and 2014 and an additional 35% and 33% had achieved partial remission in 2013 and 2014, respectively. At follow-up, 42% were in full remission after treatment during both 2013 and 2014; an additional 35% and 33% were in partial remission during 2013 and 2014, respectively. Confidence ellipses occupied the south-east (SE) and south-west (SW) quadrants of the incremental cost-effectiveness plane at both post-treatment and at follow-up, indicating that the ICBT treatment was less costly and equally effective after staff reallocation.



Conclusion
Treating patients to the target of full remission using psychologists instead of medical specialists for post-treatment assessment is cost-saving and consequently a more valuable use of limited resources. TDABC may be a useful tool for measuring resource costs, identifying quality improvement opportunities and evaluating the consequences of such initiatives. Combining TDABC with clinical outcome measures in CEA is potentially a useful approach in mental healthcare to estimate the value of process improvement initiatives.",14,"['was accomplished', 'was collected', 'was used', 'were measured', 'was performed', 'was maintained']",6,6,0.42857142857142855,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165389,Combining Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing with Clinical Outcome in Cost-Effectiveness Analysis to Measure Value in Treatment of Depression

Background
A major problem in pain medicine is the lack of knowledge about which treatment suits a specific patient. We tested the ability of quantitative sensory testing to predict the analgesic effect of pregabalin and placebo in patients with chronic pancreatitis.



Methods
Sixty-four patients with painful chronic pancreatitis received pregabalin (150–300 mg BID) or matching placebo for three consecutive weeks. Analgesic effect was documented in a pain diary based on a visual analogue scale. Responders were defined as patients with a reduction in clinical pain score of 30% or more after three weeks of study treatment compared to baseline recordings. Prior to study medication, pain thresholds to electric skin and pressure stimulation were measured in dermatomes T10 (pancreatic area) and C5 (control area). To eliminate inter-subject differences in absolute pain thresholds an index of sensitivity between stimulation areas was determined (ratio of pain detection thresholds in pancreatic versus control area, ePDT ratio). Pain modulation was recorded by a conditioned pain modulation paradigm. A support vector machine was used to screen sensory parameters for their predictive power of pregabalin efficacy.



Results
The pregabalin responders group was hypersensitive to electric tetanic stimulation of the pancreatic area (ePDT ratio 1.2 (0.9–1.3)) compared to non-responders group (ePDT ratio: 1.6 (1.5–2.0)) (P = 0.001). The electrical pain detection ratio was predictive for pregabalin effect with a classification accuracy of 83.9% (P = 0.007). The corresponding sensitivity was 87.5% and specificity was 80.0%. No other parameters were predictive of pregabalin or placebo efficacy.



Conclusions
The present study provides first evidence that quantitative sensory testing predicts the analgesic effect of pregabalin in patients with painful chronic pancreatitis. The method can be used to tailor pain medication based on patient’s individual sensory profile and thus comprises a significant step towards personalized pain medicine.",15,"['was documented', 'were defined', 'were measured', 'was determined', 'was recorded', 'was used', 'can be used']",7,7,0.4666666666666667,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0057963,Quantitative Sensory Testing Predicts Pregabalin Efficacy in Painful Chronic Pancreatitis

Of particular importance to the cognitive capacities that are uniquely human is the fronto-polar cortex (Brodmann's area 10), which is disproportionally larger in humans relative to the rest of the brain than it is in the ape's brain. The specific function of this brain region remains poorly understood, but recent neuroimaging studies have proposed that it may hold goals in mind while exploring and processing secondary goals.



Principal Findings
Here we show that the extent of damage to the fronto-polar cortex predicts impairment in the management of multiple goals. This result reveals that the integrity of the fronto-polar cortex is necessary to perform tasks that require subjects to maintain a primary goal in mind while processing secondary goals, an ability which is crucial for complex human cognitive abilities.



Conclusion/Significance
These results provide important new insights concerning the cerebral basis of complex human cognition such as planning and multitasking.",6,[],0,0,0.0,0,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003227,Damage to the Fronto-Polar Cortex Is Associated with Impaired Multitasking

Background
A major symptom of Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID; formerly Multiple Personality Disorder) is dissociative amnesia, the inability to recall important personal information. Only two case studies have directly addressed autobiographical memory in DID. Both provided evidence suggestive of dissociative amnesia. The aim of the current study was to objectively assess transfer of autobiographical information between identities in a larger sample of DID patients.



Methods
Using a concealed information task, we assessed recognition of autobiographical details in an amnesic identity. Eleven DID patients, 27 normal controls, and 23 controls simulating DID participated. Controls and simulators were matched to patients on age, education level, and type of autobiographical memory tested.



Findings
Although patients subjectively reported amnesia for the autobiographical details included in the task, the results indicated transfer of information between identities.



Conclusion
The results call for a revision of the DID definition. The amnesia criterion should be modified to emphasize its subjective nature.",10,"['were matched', 'should be modified']",2,2,0.2,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0040580,Inter-Identity Autobiographical Amnesia in Patients with Dissociative Identity Disorder
"Abstract

Background
A Mediterranean diet has a recognized beneficial effect on health and longevity, with a protective influence on several cancers. However, its association with breast cancer risk remains unclear.



Objective
We aimed to investigate whether adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern influences breast cancer risk.



Design
The Swedish Women’s Lifestyle and Health cohort study includes 49,258 women aged 30 to 49 years at recruitment in 1991–1992. Consumption of foods and beverages was measured at enrollment using a food frequency questionnaire. A Mediterranean diet score was constructed based on the consumption of alcohol, vegetables, fruits, legumes, cereals, fish, the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fat, and dairy and meat products. Relative risks (RR) for breast cancer and specific tumor characteristics (invasiveness, histological type, estrogen/progesterone receptor status, malignancy grade and stage) associated with this score were estimated using Cox regression controlling for potential confounders.



Results
1,278 incident breast cancers were diagnosed. Adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern was not statistically significantly associated with reduced risk of breast cancer overall, or with specific breast tumor characteristics. A RR (95% confidence interval) for breast cancer associated with a two-point increment in the Mediterranean diet score was 1.08 (1.00–1.15) in all women, and 1.10 (1.01–1.21) and 1.02 (0.91–1.15) in premenopausal and postmenopausal women, respectively. When alcohol was excluded from the Mediterranean diet score, results became not statistically significant.



Conclusions
Adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern did not decrease breast cancer risk in this cohort of relatively young women.",13,"['was measured', 'was constructed', 'were estimated', 'were diagnosed', 'was excluded']",5,5,0.38461538461538464,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055374,Mediterranean Dietary Pattern and Risk of Breast Cancer
"Abstract

Background
A meta-analysis as part of a systematic review aims to provide a thorough, comprehensive and unbiased statistical summary of data from the literature. However, relevant study results could be missing from a meta-analysis because of selective publication and inadequate dissemination. If missing outcome data differ systematically from published ones, a meta-analysis will be biased with an inaccurate assessment of the intervention effect. As part of the EU-funded OPEN project (www.open-project.eu) we conducted a systematic review that assessed whether the inclusion of data that were not published at all and/or published only in the grey literature influences pooled effect estimates in meta-analyses and leads to different interpretation.



Methods and findings
Systematic review of published literature (methodological research projects). Four bibliographic databases were searched up to February 2016 without restriction of publication year or language. Methodological research projects were considered eligible for inclusion if they reviewed a cohort of meta-analyses which (i) compared pooled effect estimates of meta-analyses of health care interventions according to publication status of data or (ii) examined whether the inclusion of unpublished or grey literature data impacts the result of a meta-analysis.
Seven methodological research projects including 187 meta-analyses comparing pooled treatment effect estimates according to different publication status were identified. Two research projects showed that published data showed larger pooled treatment effects in favour of the intervention than unpublished or grey literature data (Ratio of ORs 1.15, 95% CI 1.04–1.28 and 1.34, 95% CI 1.09–1.66). In the remaining research projects pooled effect estimates and/or overall findings were not significantly changed by the inclusion of unpublished and/or grey literature data. The precision of the pooled estimate was increased with narrower 95% confidence interval.



Conclusions
Although we may anticipate that systematic reviews and meta-analyses not including unpublished or grey literature study results are likely to overestimate the treatment effects, current empirical research shows that this is only the case in a minority of reviews. Therefore, currently, a meta-analyst should particularly consider time, effort and costs when adding such data to their analysis. Future research is needed to identify which reviews may benefit most from including unpublished or grey data.",15,"['will be biased', 'were not published', 'were searched', 'were considered', 'were identified', 'were not significantly changed', 'was increased', 'is needed']",8,8,0.5333333333333333,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0176210,Systematic review finds that study data not published in full text articles have unclear impact on meta-analyses results in medical research
"Abstract

Background
A minority of scientific journals publishes the majority of scientific papers and receives the majority of citations. The extent of concentration of the most influential articles is less well known.



Methods/Principal Findings
The 100 most-cited papers in the last decade in each of 21 scientific fields were analyzed; fields were considered as ecosystems and their “species” (journal) diversity was evaluated. Only 9% of journals in Journal Citation Reports had published at least one such paper. Among this 9%, half of them had published only one such paper. The number of journals that had published a larger number of most-cited papers decreased exponentially according to a Lotka law. Except for three scientific fields, six journals accounted for 53 to 94 of the 100 most-cited papers in their field. With increasing average number of citations per paper (citation density) in a scientific field, concentration of the most-cited papers in a few journals became even more prominent (p<0.001). Concentration was unrelated to the number of papers published or number of journals available in a scientific field. Multidisciplinary journals accounted for 24% of all most-cited papers, with large variability across fields. The concentration of most-cited papers in multidisciplinary journals was most prominent in fields with high citation density (correlation coefficient 0.70, p<0.001). Multidisciplinary journals had published fewer than eight of the 100 most-cited papers in eight scientific fields (none in two fields). Journals concentrating most-cited original articles often differed from those concentrating most-cited reviews. The concentration of the most-influential papers was stronger than the already prominent concentration of papers published and citations received.



Conclusions
Despite a plethora of available journals, the most influential papers are extremely concentrated in few journals, especially in fields with high citation density. Existing multidisciplinary journals publish selectively most-cited papers from fields with high citation density.",15,"['were analyzed', 'were considered', 'was evaluated']",3,1,0.06666666666666667,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000005,Concentration of the Most-Cited Papers in the Scientific Literature: Analysis of Journal Ecosystems
"Abstract

Background
A mixed methods study was undertaken in the Kachia Grazing Reserve of northern Nigeria. Surveys in March, June and October 2011 included focus group discussions, key informant and in-depth household interviews, concerning livelihood practices, animal health, ownership, and productivity. In May 2011, 249 Fulani families fleeing post-election violence entered the reserve with their livestock, increasing the number of households by one third.



Results
Despite being settled within a grazing reserve, over half of households sent all their cattle away on seasonal transhumance and another third sent some away. Cattle accounted for 96% of total tropical livestock units (TLU), of which 26% were cattle kept permanently outside the reserve. While all households cited livestock as their main source of income, 90% grew crops and 55% derived income from off-farm activities. A multiple correspondence analysis showed that for each extra member of a household its TLU value increased by 2.0 [95% CI, 1.4–2.7], while for each additional marriage its TLU increased by 15.7 [95% CI, 7.1–24.3]. A strong association was also observed between small herds, small households with only one wife, alongside marked geographical wealth differences within the reserve. New immigrant families had larger household sizes (33) and livestock holdings (122 TLU) than old settlers (22 people and 67 TLU). Prior to the mass immigration, the distribution of TLU per person was unimodal: 41% of households were classified as ‘poor’ and 27% as ‘medium’, whereas post-immigration it was bi-modal, with 26% classified as ‘very poor’ and 28% as ‘medium’.



Conclusions
While cattle remain the principal source of Fulani income and wealth, the inhabitants of Kachia Grazing Reserve have diversified their livelihood strategies to respond to changing circumstances and stress, especially the limited availability of grazing within the reserve and political insecurity outside, resulting in continued transhumance, the maintenance of smaller livestock holdings and pushing households into poverty.",11,"['was undertaken', 'being settled', 'cattle kept', 'was also observed', 'were classified']",5,5,0.45454545454545453,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172866,"Wealth, household heterogeneity and livelihood diversification of Fulani pastoralists in the Kachia Grazing Reserve, northern Nigeria, during a period of social transition"

Background
A national cross-sectional survey was conducted in Japan. This is because the growing recognition of the social determinants of health has stimulated research on social capital and mental health. In recent years, systematic reviews have found that social capital may be a useful factor in the prevention of mental illness. Despite these studies, evidence on the association between social capital and mental health is limited as there have been few empirical discussions that adopt a multilevel framework to assess whether social capital at the ecological level is associated with individual mental health. The aim of this study was to use the multilevel approach to investigate the association between neighborhood social capital and mental health after taking into account potential individual confounders.



Methodology/Principal Findings
We conducted a multilevel analysis on 5,956 individuals nested within 199 neighborhoods. The outcome variable of self-reported mental health was measured by the one dimension of SF-36 and was summed to calculate a score ranging from 0 to 100. This study showed that high levels of cognitive social capital, measured by trust (regression coefficient = 9.56), and high levels of structural social capital, measured by membership in sports, recreation, hobby, or cultural groups (regression coefficient = 8.72), were associated with better mental health after adjusting for age, sex, household income, and educational attainment. Furthermore, after adjusting for social capital perceptions at the individual level, we found that the association between social capital and mental health also remained.



Conclusions/Significance
Our findings suggest that both cognitive and structural social capital at the ecological level may influence mental health, even after adjusting for individual potential confounders including social capital perceptions. Promoting social capital may contribute to enhancing the mental health of the Japanese.",10,"['was conducted', 'is limited', 'was measured', 'was summed']",4,3,0.3,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013214,Social Capital and Mental Health in Japan: A Multilevel Analysis

Background
A new intervention, Tobacco Cessation on Prescription (TCP), has been developed in the Swedish primary health care (PHC) setting to address inequalities in health caused by tobacco use. It consists of counseling for at least 10 minutes, an individualized prescription of tobacco cessation treatment and follow-up on at least one occasion. TCP is currently being tested in clinical practice for the first time but there is a lack of knowledge about how it is perceived by health care providers.



Aim
To explore PHC provider’s perceived barriers and facilitators of implementing TCP as an intervention targeting a context with socioeconomically disadvantaged groups in Sweden.



Methods
Directed content analysis of transcripts from eight semi-structured interviews and one focus group interview with PHC providers with personal experience of TCP as informants. Data collection and analysis was guided by The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.



Results
Perceived facilitators of implementing TCP were increased self-efficacy among the informants and involvement in the treatment among patients, which led to more intensive counseling and advice being taken more seriously by patients. Lack of resources, routines, and collaboration to work with tobacco cessation and lack of knowledge, motivation and self-efficacy among colleagues were perceived as barriers. Motivation and self-efficacy to quit was perceived as low among some patients, which was explained by low social support to quit, negative attitude and low adherence to treatment and tobacco being used as a coping strategy for life stress. Access to treatment for patients was limited by cost of treatment, long waiting times and focus on face-to-face counseling.



Conclusion
TCP was perceived positively by the informants but access to treatment for patients was partly limited by how tobacco cessation services were organized. Lack of structural support, resources and differing attitudes among PHC providers need to be addressed to facilitate its implementation.",12,"['has been developed', 'being tested', 'is perceived', 'was guided', 'were increased', 'being taken', 'were perceived', 'was perceived', 'was explained', 'being used', 'was limited', 'was perceived', 'was partly limited', 'were organized', 'be addressed']",15,9,0.75,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0212641,Tobacco Cessation on Prescription as a primary health care intervention targeting a context with socioeconomically disadvantaged groups in Sweden: A qualitative study of perceived implementation barriers and facilitators among providers

Background
A newly introduced cell-free fetal DNA sequencing based non-invasive prenatal testing (DNA-NIPT) detects Down syndrome with sensitivity of 99% at early gestational stage without risk of miscarriage. Attention has been given to its public health implications; little is known from consumer perspectives. This qualitative study aimed to explore women’s motivations for using, and perceptions of, DNA-NIPT in Hong Kong. 



Methods and Findings
In-depth interviews were conducted with 45 women who had undertaken DNA-NIPT recruited by purposive sampling based on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. The sample included 31 women identified as high-risk from serum and ultrasound based Down syndrome screening (SU-DSS). Thematic narrative analysis examined informed-decision making of the test and identified the benefits and needs. Women outlined a number of reasons for accessing DNA-NIPT: reducing the uncertainty associated with risk probability-based results from SU-DSS, undertaking DNA-NIPT as a comprehensive measure to counteract risk from childbearing especially at advanced age, perceived predictive accuracy and absence of risk of harm to fetus. Accounts of women deemed high-risk or not high-risk are distinctive in a number of respects. High-risk women accessed DNA-NIPT to get a clearer idea of their risk. This group perceived SU-DSS as an unnecessary and confusing procedure because of its varying, protocol-dependent detection rates. Those women not deemed high-risk, in contrast, undertook DNA-NIPT for psychological assurance and to reduce anxiety even after receiving the negative result from SU-DSS. 



Conclusions
DNA-NIPT was regarded positively by women who chose this method of screening over the routine, less expensive testing options. Given its perceived utility, health providers need to consider whether DNA-NIPT should be offered as part of universal routine care to women at high-risk for fetal aneuploidy. If this is the case, then further development of guidelines and quality assurance will be needed to provide a service suited to patients’ needs.",14,"['has been given', 'is known', 'were conducted', 'was regarded', 'should be offered', 'will be needed']",6,5,0.35714285714285715,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081794,Motivations for Undertaking DNA Sequencing-Based Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing for Fetal Aneuploidy: A Qualitative Study with Early Adopter Patients in Hong Kong
"Abstract

Background
A Noh mask worn by expert actors when performing on a Japanese traditional Noh drama is suggested to convey countless different facial expressions according to different angles of head/body orientation. The present study addressed the question of how different facial parts of a Noh mask, including the eyebrows, the eyes, and the mouth, may contribute to different emotional expressions. Both experimental situations of active creation and passive recognition of emotional facial expressions were introduced.



Methodology/Principal Findings
In Experiment 1, participants either created happy or sad facial expressions, or imitated a face that looked up or down, by actively changing each facial part of a Noh mask image presented on a computer screen. For an upward tilted mask, the eyebrows and the mouth shared common features with sad expressions, whereas the eyes with happy expressions. This contingency tended to be reversed for a downward tilted mask. Experiment 2 further examined which facial parts of a Noh mask are crucial in determining emotional expressions. Participants were exposed to the synthesized Noh mask images with different facial parts expressing different emotions. Results clearly revealed that participants primarily used the shape of the mouth in judging emotions. The facial images having the mouth of an upward/downward tilted Noh mask strongly tended to be evaluated as sad/happy, respectively.



Conclusions/Significance
The results suggest that Noh masks express chimeric emotional patterns, with different facial parts conveying different emotions This appears consistent with the principles of Noh which highly appreciate subtle and composite emotional expressions, as well as with the mysterious facial expressions observed in Western art. It was further demonstrated that the mouth serves as a diagnostic feature in characterizing the emotional expressions. This indicates the superiority of biologically-driven factors over the traditionally formulated performing styles when evaluating the emotions of the Noh masks.",14,"['mask worn', 'is suggested', 'were introduced', 'be reversed', 'were exposed', 'be evaluated', 'was further demonstrated']",7,6,0.42857142857142855,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050280,The Mysterious Noh Mask: Contribution of Multiple Facial Parts to the Recognition of Emotional Expressions
"Abstract

Background
A Noh mask, worn by expert actors during performance on the Japanese traditional Noh drama, conveys various emotional expressions despite its fixed physical properties. How does the mask change its expressions? Shadows change subtly during the actual Noh drama, which plays a key role in creating elusive artistic enchantment. We here describe evidence from two experiments regarding how attached shadows of the Noh masks influence the observers’ recognition of the emotional expressions.



Methodology/Principal Findings
In Experiment 1, neutral-faced Noh masks having the attached shadows of the happy/sad masks were recognized as bearing happy/sad expressions, respectively. This was true for all four types of masks each of which represented a character differing in sex and age, even though the original characteristics of the masks also greatly influenced the evaluation of emotions. Experiment 2 further revealed that frontal Noh mask images having shadows of upward/downward tilted masks were evaluated as sad/happy, respectively. This was consistent with outcomes from preceding studies using actually tilted Noh mask images.



Conclusions/Significance
Results from the two experiments concur that purely manipulating attached shadows of the different types of Noh masks significantly alters the emotion recognition. These findings go in line with the mysterious facial expressions observed in Western paintings, such as the elusive qualities of Mona Lisa’s smile. They also agree with the aesthetic principle of Japanese traditional art “yugen (profound grace and subtlety)”, which highly appreciates subtle emotional expressions in the darkness.",11,"['were recognized', 'were evaluated']",2,2,0.18181818181818182,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0071389,Shadows Alter Facial Expressions of Noh Masks

Background
A novel avian-origin influenza A(H7N9) caused a major outbreak in Mainland China in early 2013. Exposure to live poultry was believed to be the major route of infection. There are limited data on how the general public changes their practices regarding live poultry exposure in response to the early outbreak of this novel influenza and the frequency of population exposure to live poultry in different areas of China.



Methodology
This study investigated population exposures to live birds from various sources during the outbreak of H7N9 in Guangzhou city, China in 2013 and compared them with those observed during the 2006 influenza A(H5N1) outbreak. Adults were telephone-interviewed using two-stage sampling, stratified by three residential areas of Guangzhou: urban areas and two semi-rural areas in one of which (Zengcheng) A(H7N9) virus was detected in a chicken from wet markets. Logistic regression models were built to describe practices protecting against avian influenza, weighted by age and gender, and then compare these practices across residential areas in 2013 with those from a comparable 2006 survey.



Principal Findings
Of 1196 respondents, 45% visited wet markets at least daily and 22.0% reported buying live birds from wet markets at least weekly in April-May, 2013, after the H7N9 epidemic was officially declared in late March 2013. Of those buying live birds, 32.3% reported touching birds when buying and 13.7% would slaughter the poultry at home. Although only 10.1% of the respondents reported raising backyard birds, 92.1% of those who did so had physical contact with the birds they raised. Zengcheng respondents were less likely to report buying live birds from wet markets, but more likely to buy from other sources when compared to urban respondents. Compared with the 2006 survey, the prevalence of buying live birds from wet markets, touching when buying and slaughtering birds at home had substantially declined in the 2013 survey.



Conclusion/Significance
Although population exposures to live poultry were substantially fewer in 2013 compared to 2006, wet markets and backyard poultry remained the two major sources of live bird exposures for the public in Guangzhou in 2013. Zengcheng residents seemed to have reduced buying live birds from wet markets but not from other sources in response to the detection of H7N9 virus in wet markets.",14,"['was believed', 'stratified by three residential areas of guangzhou: urban areas and two semi-rural areas in one of which (zengcheng) a(h7n9) virus was detected in a chicken from wet markets', 'were built', 'weighted by age and gender, and then compare these practices across residential areas in 2013 with those from a comparable 2006 survey', 'was officially declared']",5,4,0.2857142857142857,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0143582,"Live Bird Exposure among the General Public, Guangzhou, China, May 2013"

Background
A novel indicator, ‘percentage of women of reproductive age who are sexually active and who have their demands for FP satisfied with modern contraceptive methods (mDFPS)’, was developed in 2012 to accelerate the reduction of unmet needs of family planning (FP). In Jordan, unmet needs for modern contraception remain high. To address this situation, this study measured the mDFPS and identified its associated factors in rural Jordan.



Methods
This cross-sectional study included married women of reproductive age (15–49 years) from ten villages in Irbid Governorate, Jordan, where advanced health facilities are difficult to reach. A two-stage stratified sampling with random sampling at the household stage was used for this field survey which was conducted between September and October 2016. Univariate analysis was used to assess the differences between mDFPS and unmet mDFPS groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the correlates of mDFPS.



Results
Of 1019 participants, 762 were identified as needing modern contraception. mDFPS coverage accounted for 54.7%. The most significant factors associated with mDFPS were the husband’s agreement on FP (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 15.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.26–45.25), knowledge of modern contraceptives (AOR: 8.76, 95% CI: 5.72–13.40), and lack of awareness of the high risk of conception in the postpartum period (AOR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.41–3.47). Duration of current residence, receipt of FP counselling at health centres and number of living children were also correlated. In addition, 95.3% of local women were aware of the presence of health centres that were mostly located in a 10-minute walking distance.



Conclusion
To increase mDFPS, this study suggested that accelerating male involvement in FP decision-making is necessary through community-based health education. Furthermore, expanding FP services in village health centres and improving the quality of FP counselling in public health facilities are required to correct misconceptions about modern methods among rural women.",14,"['was developed', 'was used', 'was conducted', 'was used', 'was performed', 'were identified', 'were also correlated', 'were mostly located', 'are required']",9,8,0.5714285714285714,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230421,Demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods and its associated factors among married women of reproductive age in rural Jordan: A cross-sectional study

Background
A number of instruments for identifying mental health problems in children are available, but there is limited knowledge about how to successfully implement their use in routine practice. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is an instrument with sound psychometric properties. Because using multi-informant SDQs when assessing young children has been emphasized, parent- and preschool teacher reports on the SDQ were introduced at Child Health Clinics in a Swedish municipality. This paper aimed to describe a facilitation programme developed to support the introduction of SDQ in clinical practice and evaluate how nurses perceived the facilitation strategies used. Moreover, the dose (delivery) and reach (response rate and population coverage) of the questionnaires were assessed.



Methods
The mixed-methods process evaluation was guided by Moore et al.’s framework. Process data were excerpted from monitoring data, the trial database, research group documents, study materials, group interviews with nurses, and a survey on nurses’ opinions and experiences of the screening method and the implementation process. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis.



Results
Facilitation strategies used included: educational meetings, educational outreach visits, newsletters, facilitative administrative support, and adaptations made in procedures and materials when required. Although nurses described a variety of barriers at the organisational and individual level, they were in favour of using the SDQ in clinical practice and emphasised the importance of the facilitation strategies used for its implementation. While dose levels (77–91%) indicated that nurses essentially delivered the intervention as intended, parental response rates remained between 54 and 63% and population coverage at around 50%, throughout the intervention period.



Conclusion
The facilitation program was perceived to support the implementation of the SDQ at the yearly check-ups in the child healthcare setting, but further efforts are required to reach all families.",14,"['has been emphasized', 'were introduced', 'were assessed', 'was guided', 'were excerpted', 'were analysed', 'was perceived', 'are required']",8,6,0.42857142857142855,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0234383,Facilitating implementation of an evidence-based method to assess the mental health of 3–5-year-old children at Child Health Clinics: A mixed-methods process evaluation

Background
A number of programs have been developed to promote the contact between adolescents and mentally-ill patients, in order to break the stigma, improve understanding, promote mental health and prevent substance abuse. The aim of this study was to describe the experience of patients with schizophrenia, high school students, and their social context, participating in a short-term cohousing initiative.



Methods
A qualitative case-study approach was implemented. Patients with schizophrenia from the San Juan de Dios Psychiatric Hospital, female students from Almen High School, and participants from their social context (parents, hospital staff, and teachers) were included, using purposeful sampling. Data were collected from 51 participants (15 patients, nine students, 11 hospital staff, six teachers, 10 parents) via non-participant observation, focus groups, informal interviews, researchers’ field notes and patients’ personal diaries and letters. A thematic analysis was performed.



Results
The themes identified included a) learning to live together: students and patients participate and learn together; b) the perception of the illness and the mentally-ill: the barrier between health and disease is very slim, and society tends to avoid contact with those who are ill; c) change: a transformation takes place in students, in their self-perception, based on the real and intense nature of the experience; d) a trial and an opportunity: patients test their ability to live outside the hospital; e) discharge and readmission: discharge is experienced as both a liberation and a difficulty, whereas relapse and readmission are experienced as failures.



Conclusions
Our findings can help us to better understand schizophrenia and encourage a more positive approach towards both the illness and those who suffer from it. These results may be used for the development of cohousing programs in controlled environments.",9,"['have been developed', 'was implemented', 'were included', 'were collected', 'was performed', 'is experienced', 'are experienced', 'may be used']",8,7,0.7777777777777778,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0190895,"The impact of a short-term cohousing initiative among schizophrenia patients, high school students, and their social context: A qualitative case study"
"Abstract

Background
A number of studies have evaluated the association between cognitive function, pain, and physical activity. To our knowledge, however, no previous studies have evaluated these factors at the population level.



Aims
To evaluate the association between cognitive function in the elderly with pain, physical activity, and the interaction between these variables. Estimates are generated for the United States population.



Methods
We made use of the NHANES database (1999–2002), making adjustments so that our results represent the United States population. Cognitive function was evaluated through the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Our main predictors were (1) pain, defined as soreness of either the shoulder, neck, lower back and joint, or a severe headache (2) physical activity, measured as the performance while performing tasks at home, physical activity intensity, walking, bicycle riding, and muscle strengthening.



Results
Most individual pain sites were not significantly associated with cognitive function, while all physical activity factors were associated with an increase in cognitive function. When evaluating the sample subset of those with cognitive scores lower than the median, a combination of more pain and less physical activity was consistently associated with lower cognitive scores when compared to those performing more physical activity with or without pain. When evaluating individuals with cognitive scores above the median, a similar association pattern was perceived.



Conclusions
Among the population of individuals above the age of 60, higher cognitive levels are associated with more physical activity and less with pain, although both factors might impact cognition. Public policy resources should be commensurate with these findings when targeting cognitive function among the aging population.",12,"['are generated', 'was evaluated', 'was perceived']",3,3,0.25,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197745,Keep moving without hurting: The interaction between physical activity and pain in determining cognitive function at the population level

This study was meant to explore cognitive impairment in German paediatric MS patients with a focus on deficits in executive functions and relate these to clinical disease parameters.



Methods and findings
Forty paediatric MS patients, which presented at the German centre for MS in childhood and adolescence, were assessed for cognitive deficits applying a very comprehensive battery of cognitive tests including the Wechsler Intelligence scale and subtests of the D-KEFS for executive functions. The performance of MS patients was compared with a group of age and sex matched healthy controls using between-subjects ANOVAs. Paediatric MS patients performed worse in tests assessing verbal comprehension and fluency, processing speed, memory, calculation skills and other executive functions. Arranged by the cognitive domain, group differences were most pronounced regarding verbal comprehension and fluency for the WISC subtests Comprehension (p = 0.000), Vocabulary (p = 0.003) and Information (p = 0.005); regarding processing speed for the written SDMT (p = 0.001) and the WISC subtest Coding (p = 0.005); regarding memory for the VLMT training (p = 0.007) and the BASIC MLT pattern learning training (p = 0.009); regarding executive functions including working memory for the WISC subtest Arithmetics (p = 0.002), the D-KEFS Design Fluency (p = 0.003) and the Corsi block tapping backward task (p = 0.003). Fluid reasoning was largely intact. Relations of cognitive performance and clinical parameters were assessed in MS patients. Disease duration was associated with a reduced performance in tests belonging to the domains verbal comprehension and fluency (WISC Vocabulary: p = 0.034, WISC Information: p = 0.015) and fluid reasoning (WISC Picture Completion: p = 0.003) as well as the WISC Working Memory Index (p = 0.047). Patients with a disease onset between 11 and 14 years performed better in fluid reasoning (WISC matrix reasoning: p = 0.024) than patients with a disease onset at an age above 14. The number of relapses negatively influenced the visual spatial memory performance (BASIC MLT pattern learning training: p = 0.009).



Conclusions
The distribution of cognitive deficits in a representative group German of paediatric MS patients was similar to the pattern known from other European and North-American cohorts. Paediatric MS patients do have cognitive deficits in executive functions and key qualities necessary for successful school performance. Disease duration, age of onset and the number of relapses influence cognitive performance. Cognitive screenings should be implemented on a regular basis for paediatric MS patients, enabling early intervention.",15,"['been comprehensively assessed', 'was meant', 'were assessed', 'was compared', 'arranged by the cognitive domain, group differences were most pronounced regarding verbal comprehension and fluency for the wisc subtests comprehension (p = 0.000), vocabulary (p = 0.003) and information (p = 0.005); regarding processing speed for the written sdmt (p = 0.001) and the wisc subtest coding (p = 0.005); regarding memory for the vlmt training (p = 0.007) and the basic mlt pattern learning training (p = 0.009); regarding executive functions including working memory for the wisc subtest arithmetics (p =', 'were assessed', 'should be implemented']",7,7,0.4666666666666667,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194873,Cognitive deficits including executive functioning in relation to clinical parameters in paediatric MS patients
"Abstract

Background
A number of studies have shown that bite and sip sizes influence the amount of food intake. Consuming with small sips instead of large sips means relatively more sips for the same amount of food to be consumed; people may believe that intake is higher which leads to faster satiation. This effect may be disturbed when people are distracted.



Objective
The objective of the study is to assess the effects of sip size in a focused state and a distracted state on ad libitum intake and on the estimated amount consumed.



Design
In this 3×2 cross-over design, 53 healthy subjects consumed ad libitum soup with small sips (5 g, 60 g/min), large sips (15 g, 60 g/min), and free sips (where sip size was determined by subjects themselves), in both a distracted and focused state. Sips were administered via a pump. There were no visual cues toward consumption. Subjects then estimated how much they had consumed by filling soup in soup bowls.



Results
Intake in the small-sip condition was ∼30% lower than in both the large-sip and free-sip conditions (P<0.001). In addition, subjects underestimated how much they had consumed in the large-sip and free-sip conditions (P<0.03). Distraction led to a general increase in food intake (P = 0.003), independent of sip size. Distraction did not influence sip size or estimations.



Conclusions
Consumption with large sips led to higher food intake, as expected. Large sips, that were either fixed or chosen by subjects themselves led to underestimations of the amount consumed. This may be a risk factor for over-consumption. Reducing sip or bite sizes may successfully lower food intake, even in a distracted state.",18,"['be consumed', 'may be disturbed', 'are distracted', 'was determined', 'were administered']",5,4,0.2222222222222222,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0053288,Consumption with Large Sip Sizes Increases Food Intake and Leads to Underestimation of the Amount Consumed
"Abstract

Background
A number of trials have examined the effects of self-guided psychological intervention, without any contact between the participants and a therapist or coach. The results and sizes of these trials have been mixed. This is the first quantitative meta-analysis, aimed at organizing and evaluating the literature, and estimating effect size.



Method
We conducted systematic literature searches in PubMed, PsycINFO and Embase up to January 2010, and identified additional studies through earlier meta-analyses, and the references of included studies. We identified seven randomized controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 1,362 respondents. The overall quality of the studies was high. A post-hoc power calculation showed that the studies had sufficient statistical power to detect an effect size of d = 0.19.



Results
The overall mean effect size indicating the difference between self-guided psychological treatment and control groups at post-test was d = 0.28 (p<0.001), which corresponds to a NNT of 6.41. At 4 to 12 months follow-up the effect size was d = 0.23. There was no indication for significant publication bias.



Conclusions
We found evidence that self-guided psychological treatment has a small but significant effect on participants with increased levels of depressive symptomatology.",11,[],0,0,0.0,0,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021274,Self-Guided Psychological Treatment for Depressive Symptoms: A Meta-Analysis
"Abstract

Background
A paradoxical enhancement of the magnitude of the N1 wave of the auditory event-related potential (ERP) has been described when auditory stimuli are presented at very short (<400 ms) inter-stimulus intervals (ISI). Here, we examined whether this enhancement is specific for the auditory system, or whether it also affects ERPs elicited by stimuli belonging to other sensory modalities.



Methodology and Principal Findings
We recorded ERPs elicited by auditory and somatosensory stimuli in 13 healthy subjects. For each sensory modality, 4800 stimuli were presented. Auditory stimuli consisted in brief tones presented binaurally, and somatosensory stimuli consisted in constant-current electrical pulses applied to the right median nerve. Stimuli were delivered continuously, and the ISI was varied randomly between 100 and 1000 ms. We found that the ISI had a similar effect on both auditory and somatosensory ERPs. In both sensory modalities, ISI had an opposite effect on the magnitude of the N1 and P2 waves: the magnitude of the auditory and the somatosensory N1 was significantly increased at ISI≤200 ms, while the magnitude of the auditory and the somatosensory P2 was significantly decreased at ISI≤200 ms.



Conclusion and Significance
The observation that both the auditory and the somatosensory N1 are enhanced at short ISIs indicates that this phenomenon reflects a physiological property that is common across sensory systems, rather than, as previously suggested, unique for the auditory system. Two of the hypotheses most frequently put forward to explain this observation, namely (i) the decreased contribution of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials to the recorded scalp ERPs and (ii) the decreased contribution of ‘latent inhibition’, are discussed. Because neither of these two hypotheses can satisfactorily account for the concomitant reduction of the auditory and the somatosensory P2, we propose a third, novel hypothesis, consisting in the modulation of a single neural component contributing to both the N1 and the P2 waves.",12,"['has been described', 'are presented', 'were presented', 'were delivered', 'was significantly increased', 'was significantly decreased', 'are enhanced', 'are discussed']",8,6,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003929,The Enhancement of the N1 Wave Elicited by Sensory Stimuli Presented at Very Short Inter-Stimulus Intervals Is a General Feature across Sensory Systems
"Abstract

Background
A patient’s journey through the health care system is influenced by clinical and system processes across the continuum of care.



Methods
To inform optimized access to care and patient flow for individuals with traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI), we developed a simulation model that can examine the full impact of therapeutic or systems interventions across the care continuum for patients with traumatic spinal cord injuries. The objective of this paper is to describe the detailed development of this simulation model for a major trauma and a rehabilitation centre in British Columbia (BC), Canada, as part of the Access to Care and Timing (ACT) project and is referred to as the BC ACT Model V1.0.



Findings
To demonstrate the utility of the simulation model in clinical and administrative decision-making we present three typical scenarios that illustrate how an investigator can track the indirect impact(s) of medical and administrative interventions, both upstream and downstream along the continuum of care. For example, the model was used to estimate the theoretical impact of a practice that reduced the incidence of pressure ulcers by 70%. This led to a decrease in acute and rehabilitation length of stay of 4 and 2 days, respectively and a decrease in bed utilization of 9% and 3% in acute and rehabilitation.



Conclusion
The scenario analysis using the BC ACT Model V1.0 demonstrates the flexibility and value of the simulation model as a decision-making tool by providing estimates of the effects of different interventions and allowing them to be objectively compared. Future work will involve developing a generalizable national Canadian ACT Model to examine differences in care delivery and identify the ideal attributes of SCI care delivery.",8,"['is influenced', 'is referred', 'was used', 'be objectively compared']",4,4,0.5,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0072552,Modeling the Patient Journey from Injury to Community Reintegration for Persons with Acute Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury in a Canadian Centre
"Abstract

Background
A person is less likely to be accurately remembered if they appear in a visual scene with a gun, a result that has been termed the weapon focus effect (WFE). Explanations of the WFE argue that weapons engage attention because they are unusual and/or threatening, which causes encoding deficits for the other items in the visual scene. Previous WFE research has always embedded the weapon and nonweapon objects within a larger context that provides information about an actor's intention to use the object. As such, it is currently unknown whether a gun automatically engages attention to a greater extent than other objects independent of the context in which it is presented.



Method
Reflexive responding to a gun compared to other objects was examined in two experiments. Experiment 1 employed a prosaccade gap-overlap paradigm, whereby participants looked toward a peripheral target, and Experiment 2 employed an antisaccade gap-overlap paradigm, whereby participants looked away from a peripheral target. In both experiments, the peripheral target was a gun or a nonthreatening object (i.e., a tomato or pocket watch). We also controlled how unexpected the targets were and compared saccadic reaction times across types of objects.



Results
A gun was not found to differentially engage attention compared to the unexpected object (i.e., a pocket watch). Some evidence was found (Experiment 2) that both the gun and the unexpected object engaged attention to a greater extent compared the expected object (i.e., a tomato).



Conclusion
An image of a gun did not engage attention to a larger extent than images of other types of objects (i.e., a pocket watch or tomato). The results suggest that context may be an important determinant of WFE. The extent to which an object is threatening may depend on the larger context in which it is presented.",13,"['be accurately remembered', 'has been termed', 'is presented', 'was examined', 'was not found', 'was found', 'is presented']",7,6,0.46153846153846156,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081011,Oculomotor Examination of the Weapon Focus Effect: Does a Gun Automatically Engage Visual Attention?
"Abstract

Background
A physical education (PE) intervention for young refugees was designed combining physical activity within the context of primary PE games with second language learning activities in German. The intervention was based on theoretical implications from the field of second language acquisition and evidence for positive effects of physical activity on cognitive outcomes (e.g. language acquisition). The aim of this study was to analyze short term effects on second language acquisition.



Methods
Sixty-one young refugees were included in the study (age: 8.5 ± 1.4 years). The intervention group participated in language-enriched PE lessons based on an elaborated approach to second language learning acquisition. The control group did not receive any treatment. Both groups were pre-and post-tested in domain specific vocabulary, listening comprehension and use of local prepositions within the context of primary PE games.



Results
Results from linear mixed-effect modelling suggest that the intervention group significantly improved domain specific vocabulary and listening comprehension in comparison to the control group.



Conclusions
The intervention was successful since the PE lessons contributed to the second language acquisition of young refugees. Therefore, this learning approach might also be useful for physical activity based second language learning activities in other PE contexts for early second language learners in primary school.",10,"['was designed', 'were included']",2,2,0.2,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0203664,Second language acquisition effects of a primary physical education intervention: A pilot study with young refugees
