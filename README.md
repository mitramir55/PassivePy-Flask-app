# PassivePy Flask App

This is a locally-run flask app that I created for the [PassivePy package](https://github.com/mitramir55/PassivePy). You can clone the repo and run the flask_app.py in your terminal like this:


``` 
python "flask_app.py"
```

Then open up the link that shows up on your terminal with a `/passivepy_page` at the end:

And Voila! You can work with different functions of passivepy without having to write code :) You can contact me for more info on this app! I'd be happy to help.
