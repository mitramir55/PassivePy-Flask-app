# PassivePy Online App

## Intro to the package ([GitHub Page](https://github.com/mitramir55/PassivePy))

Our aim with this work is to create a reliable (e.g., passive voice judgments are consistent), valid (e.g., passive voice judgments are accurate), flexible (e.g., texts can be assessed at different units of analysis), replicable (e.g., the approach can be performed by a range of research teams with varying levels of computational expertise), and scalable way (e.g., small and large collections of texts can be analyzed) to capture passive voice from different corpora for social and psychological evaluations of text.

You can try it out [**here**](https://intense-hamlet-85007.herokuapp.com/).

## Run locally

You can clone the repo and run the flask_app.py in your terminal like this:


``` 
python "flask_app.py"
```

Then open up the link that shows up on your terminal.

And Voila! You can work with different functions of passivepy without having to write code :) You can contact me for more info on this app! I'd be happy to help.
